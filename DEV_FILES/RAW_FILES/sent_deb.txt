Vodafone is considering joining the bidding for Tiscali as the Italian telecoms group set a deadline of May 5 for initial non-binding offers .

Vodafone already has interests in Italy , having agreed last October to buy the Italian broadband business owned by Tele2 , the country 's fifth-largest internet access provider .
Investors are happier with Mr Colao in part because of the prospect of a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator that Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake in .
Verizon Communications , the controlling shareholder in Verizon Wireless , has been blocking pay-outs since 2005 , in an apparent attempt to squeeze Vodafone out , but said in June that dividends might restart in 2012 .
Vodafone is therefore getting a revenue fillip as its customers increasingly switch to smartphones , but the challenge is whether this one-off boost can be turned into long term growth .
Vodafone prepares fresh round of cost cutting as revenues fall
Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , is preparing a fresh round of cost cutting as he tries to offset falling revenue at the mobile phone operator .
Vodafone 's shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 16 per cent this year , partly because of concern at how the UK company 's underlying revenue at most of its core European businesses is falling .

Some of Vodafone 's main European businesses , such as those in the UK and Spain , are expected to report declining revenue , because consumers are spending less on their mobile phones during the recession .
Analysts at Bernstein say one possible piece of good news is the potential for an earlier than expected resumption of dividend payments by Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator .
Verizon Wireless stopped issuing dividends in 2005 , after Verizon Communications decided to use Verizon Wireless 's cash flow to pay down the mobile operator 's debt .
When Verizon Wireless last year agreed to buy Alltel , a smaller rival , Vodafone said it did not expect a resumption of dividend payments until 2012 .

Vodafone reveals plan for pound(s)1bn share buy-back
Vodafone has taken the unusual step of revealing a pound(s)1bn share buy-back in immediate response to the record sell-off of its stock after Tuesday 's revenue warning .
Announcing the pound(s)1bn share buy-back yesterday , the company said : " This action reflects the board 's belief that the share price significantly undervalues Vodafone . "
Graham Secker , equity strategist at Morgan Stanley , said Vodafone 's share buyback , while unusual , may be well timed .
Vodafone scaled back its revenue forecast for 2008-09 at its first-quarter trading update , partly because some people were delaying upgrades of mobile phones .
On March 31 , Vodafone had net debt of pound(s)25.2bn.
Standard & Poor 's , the ratings agency , said Vodafone 's ratings were unchanged by the buy-back , but added : " A weakening of operating performance . . . or any future revision of guidance for 2009 , could put pressure on the ratings and outlook . "

While announcing annual results that may show a record pre-tax loss , Vodafone is expected to reassure investors that it is not looking to revive slowing revenue growth by buying more mobile operators in emerging markets .
Vodafone was built into the world 's biggest mobile phone operator by revenue by a series of large deals such as the Pounds 101bn acquisition of Germany 's Mannesman in 2000 .
Vodafone had already rattled investors in November by warning that revenue growthwould be lower in 2007 than in 2006 .
Vodafone 's annual results for 2006 may show it reporting a bigger pre-tax loss than the Pounds 13.5bn recorded in 2002 because of a write-down in the value of its assets .

Verizon Wireless , the largest US mobile operator , stopped paying a dividend to its corporate parents , Verizon Communications and Vodafone , in 2005 .
Vodafone set for service revenue dip

unused1 First-half margins are expected to be slightly lower at about 31 per cent , with falling European margins likely to be offset by expansion in South Africa and India .
unused1 Consensus first-half earnings are put at pound(s)6.8bn , a 10 per cent decline but mostly owing to foreign exchange movements .
unused1 Stripping out this , analysts expect group ebitda to be down about 2.5 per cent in the first half .
If the competition authorities approve plans for a merger between France Telecom 's Orange UK and Deutsche Telekom 's TMobile UK , the new entity would become the market leader , with O2 in second place .
Ben Wood , analyst at CCS Insight , said Vodafone would be the biggest loser from a merger between Orange UK and T-Mobile UK , which are the third and fourth-largest mobile operators respectively .
Meanwhile , analysts said O2 's chances of retaining its status as the exclusive UK network for Apple 's popular iPhone have been diminished by the merger plans involving Orange UK and T-Mobile UK .
unused1 The French and German companies are expected to argue that the pound(s)3.5bn ( $5.8bn ) of cost savings sought in the merger should enable higher investment in networks that will support web surfing and other data activities on mobile phones and laptops .
Vodafone shares drop on news of UK profits fall
Vodafone 's shares fell more than 4 per cent yesterday after the mobile phone group revealed how the profitability of its UK business had been hurt by a dash for top-line growth .
unused1 The shares dipped 5.5 per cent in mid-afternoon trading after the disclosure that the UK margin on earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation had declined from 34 per cent in the six months to March 31 last year to 26.6 per cent in the five months to February 28 this year .
Mr Sarin sought to allay investor concern by drawing attention to Vodafone 's guidance last May that the group 's ebitda margin would fall by one percentage point in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 .
Cuts in Vodafone 's tariffs have bolstered revenue growth , partly by attracting new customers .
unused1 Service revenue growth increased 5 per cent in January and February compared with the same period last year .
unused1 " The UK margins are weaker than expected and , while revenue growth is stronger , we doubt it will be able to sustain this higher growth rate for long , " said Martin Mabbutt , analyst at Nomura , who has a " buy " rating on the stock .
unused1 Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded their recommendation on Vodafone 's shares from " buy " to " sell " after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at Vodafone 's European mobile businesses by Pounds 900m ( Dollars 1.78bn ) between 2009 and 2012 .
Meanwhile , Vodafone also had a further setback in its efforts to secure control of Vodacom , South Africa 's leading mobile operator .
unused1 He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would reduce Vodafone 's European earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation by 11 per cent , or Pounds 900m .
unused1 That would equate to a 8 per cent cut in the group 's ebitda .
US telecoms group Verizon denied it was considering a bid for Vodafone , halting a rally across Europe 's telecom sector .
They were most bearish on Telecom Italia , TeliaSonera and France Telecom , cutting UBS ratings on all three companies ' stock to " sell " .
unused1 UBS analysts cut their target price for the shares to EUR0.45.
unused1 Analysts lowered their target on the shares to SKr38 .
France Telecom , meanwhile , saw its target price lowered to EUR6.80.
unused1 Analysts at JPMorgan increased their target on the Danish bank 's shares from DKr120 to DKr125 , giving the stock an " overweight " rating .

unused1 Vodafone 's EUR8bn ( $11.4bn ) sale to Vivendi of a 44 per cent stake in the French mobile phone business SFR , announced on Monday , is the biggest in a series of disposals of minority holdings .
Analysts broadly agreed that Vodafone secured a good price for its stake in SFR , given that Vivendi - which owned the remaining shares in the group - had been reported to be unwilling to pay more than pound(s)6bn ( $9.7bn ) .
unused1 The SFR deal will allow Vodafone to pay down debt , which , according to Merrill Lynch , will give the company " a huge credit tailwind in a sector starved of credit improvement stories " .
Verizon Wireless has not paid a dividend since 2005 , after its parent insisted that cash generated be used to pay down debt .
