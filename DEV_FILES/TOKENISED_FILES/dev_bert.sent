Mr Lucas said the pay ##out ratio would be higher in future , but would remain substantially below the 50 per cent that Barclay ##s has traditionally distributed .
unused ##1 The bank said first ##- ##hal ##f headline pre ##- ##ta ##x profits fell 71 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##75 ##9 ##m .
unused ##1 The steep fall in Barclay ##s ' statutory pre ##- ##ta ##x profit was mainly at ##tri ##but ##able to a pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##9 ##5 ##b ##n " own credit " accounting loss on the flu ##ct ##uating value of its issued debt .

Consider Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s performance in fixed income , cu ##rre ##ncies and commodities , where revenue rose 9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n from a year ago .
That suggests Bar ##C ##ap is maintaining , even increasing , its share .
unused ##1 Or take the unit ' ##s e ##quities revenue , up just 1 per cent .
Yet that makes Bar ##C ##ap and Morgan Stanley the only investment banks to report an increase so far .
unused ##1 Overall , revenue at the UK lend ##er ' ##s wholesale bank climbed 3 per cent , compared with Deutsche ' ##s 11 per cent decline , itself in line with JP ##M ##or ##gan Chase ' ##s comparable revenue drop .
Deutsche ' ##s F ##IC ##C machine , meanwhile , generated income of EU ##R ##3 ##. ##4 ##b ##n , 8 per cent lower than a year ago but still t ##rump ##ing its UK rival by EU ##R ##500 ##m .
That may be less than the one ##- ##fi ##ft ##h F ##IC ##C decline at Credit Su ##isse , but US peers ' equivalent revenues rose 5 per cent .
unused ##1 It was a different story in e ##quities , however : the German investment bank ' ##s revenue slid 23 per cent , although at EU ##R ##7 ##26 ##m it was still higher than Barclay ##s ' number .
In 2007 , the Le ##hman debt and equity under ##writing and merger advice business alone generated $ ##4 ##b ##n in revenue , ranking it ninth globally , according to Deal ##og ##ic .

Tu ##i , the German travel agency , gained 9 ##. ##6 per cent to Euro ##s 18 ##. ##10 after announcing ##it would merge its tour operating business with that ##of First Choice Holiday ##s of the UK .
" We regard the deal as a sensible reaction to the recent merger of Thomas Cook and My ##T ##rave ##l , " said Frank S ##ko ##d ##zi ##k at West ##L ##B .
Ku ##oni , the Swiss travel company , gained 2 ##. ##4 per cent to SF ##r ##7 ##29 after U ##BS raised its price target on the stock from SF ##r ##6 ##35 to SF ##r ##7 ##25 after last week ' ##s announcement of record full ##- ##ye ##ar net profits and proposed divide ##nd of SF ##r ##15 a share .
Spanish tobacco group Alt ##adi ##s rose 6 ##. ##4 per cent to Euro ##s 46 ##. ##55 as it held out for higher bids after it on Friday rejected a Euro ##s 45 ##- a ##- ##sha ##re offer from Imperial Tobacco , of the UK .
Barclay ##s ' first ##- ##qua ##rter profit surged by almost 47 per cent , yet its shares slid by more than 6 per cent yesterday .
In part , the strong fixed income , cu ##rre ##ncies and commodities ( F ##IC ##C ) performances from Goldman Sachs , JP ##M ##or ##gan and Deutsche Bank had s ##tok ##ed expectations that Barclay ##s Capital would also shoot the lights out .
But instead , Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue was down 26 per cent on last year , and top ##- ##line income from F ##IC ##C was almost 40 per cent lower , compared with the roughly 10 per cent fall at other investment banks .
Credit Su ##isse ' ##s recent first ##- ##qua ##rter results disappointed for much the same reason .
Although Barclay ##s ' pre ##- ##ta ##x profits rose by 47 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , helped by a sharp fall in imp ##air ##ments , Bar ##C ##ap accounted for more than four ##- ##fi ##ft ##hs of them .
Given that the market conditions of the first two quarters of last year are unlikely to be repeated , another way to see Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue decline is as setting a more normal quarterly run ##- ##rate of pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ##- ##po ##und ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##b ##n , Credit Su ##isse notes .
For a bank that has had a trick ##y year in its core UK retail business , Barclay ##s ' 15 per cent jump in full year pre ##- ##ta ##x profits looks impressive .
This does not mean that all in the domestic garden is r ##osy : performance was shore ##d up by strong earnings growth at Barclay ##s Capital , the investment banking arm , and B ##GI , the global fund management business .
unused ##1 And , excluding its South African acquisition A ##bs ##a , growth drops to
A rise in bad debt provisions helped de ##press earnings on Barclay ##card , but that trend should slow this year .

Overall , Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue fell 15 per cent from a year ago .
unused ##1 Given the 8 ##. ##1 per cent achieved in the normally strong first quarter , that looks like a stretch .
unused ##1 E ##ar ##ning ##s recovery , and the ability to generate capital internally , could take longer than expected - earnings forecast ##s for 2013 are a fifth lower than they were two years ago .
Yet despite this uncertainty Barclay ##s has become more generous on divide ##nds , p ##led ##ging to pay more , and sooner .

The move , which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be formally completed by November , marks a fast return to acquisitions for BA ##SF after its almost EU ##R ##4 ##b ##n takeover of Swiss rival C ##iba in 2008 .

BA ##SF , advised by ##L ##azar ##d , initially hesitated to pay more than EU ##R ##3 ##b ##n as it was wary of being seen to be over ##pa ##ying after its acquisition of C ##iba drew criticism .

unused ##1 The group ' ##s statutory pre ##- ##ta ##x profit , which included a $ 2 ##. ##64 ##b ##n accounting loss related to flu ##ct ##uations in the value of its issued debt , was $ 4 ##. ##32 ##b ##n for the first three months of the year , down from $ 4 ##. ##9 ##1 ##b ##n in the first quarter of 2011 .
unused ##1 However , recent signs of a b ##lip in the growth trend in Brazil pushed up loan losses there by about $ 250 ##m .
H ##SB ##C has begun its expansion in consumer finance in emerging markets including China , India , Mexico and Turkey , by targeting lower ##- ##in ##come customers with the techniques of Household International , the US company it acquired for USD ##oll ##ars 13 ##b ##n in 2003 .
Household ' ##s model - borrow ##ing funds at low interest rates and lending them out at much higher ones to " sub ##- ##p ##rim ##e " customers - has become a key driver of profit growth at H ##SB ##C .
unused ##1 In 2004 , the personal finance business , which includes credit cards , accounted for about 30 per cent of group profit .
Mr Green also indicated H ##SB ##C was not looking at acquisitions in South Africa , a market in the spotlight after Barclay ##s bought a majority stake in A ##bs ##a for R ##33 ##b ##n ( Dollar ##s 5 ##. ##0 ##4 ##b ##n ) - the biggest foreign investment in the country since the end of apartheid .
H ##SB ##C added to concerns about consumer debt yesterday , saying it had seen a " marked " increase in bad and doubtful debts in the first quarter .
unused ##1 Mr To ##eman said US bankrupt ##cies were picking up ahead of a change in legislation and while the bank ' ##s US business had a positive first quarter , that could be " as good as it gets " .
He also defended Shell ' ##s position of offering no increase in quarterly divide ##nd payments of 42 cents over three years since 2009 .
Shell nudged the payment up by a 1 cent to 43 cents in April .
Jury still out on Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s first ##- ##qua ##rter sales recovery
Un ##ile ##ver b ##uck ##ed its recent de ##pressing trend with a surprise increase in underlying sales growth during the first quarter .
Ana ##ly ##sts and investors had been wary of poor first ##- ##qua ##rter results from Un ##ile ##ver , which has struggled with declining sales in recent years .
But Un ##ile ##ver said its competitive position had improved over the past six months , with sales growing 2 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier , excluding the impact of extra trading days .
unused ##1 Most of the increase was down to healthy sales of Un ##ile ##ver products in emerging markets .
unused ##1 In Asia and Africa , the company ' ##s underlying sales rose by some 7 per cent .
unused ##1 Europe remained weak even as the company cut prices to try and improve its competitive position , and sales dropped 2 per cent .
unused ##1 Sales rose 4 per cent in the Americas .
unused ##1 Pre ##- ##ta ##x profit was up 8 ##. ##5 per cent to Euro ##s 1 ##. ##28 ##b ##n ( Pound ##s 86 ##7 ##m ) .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts said it is too early to tell whether the first ##- ##qua ##rter rise in underlying sales growth would be sustained .
unused ##1 Re ##lative ##ly low investment in A ##& ##P may be boost ##ing Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s profit margins , one analyst said .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s overall turnover fell 6 per cent in 2004 compared with the year before , while net profit fell 32 per cent and underlying sales rose just 0 ##. ##4 per cent .
In May , V ##oda ##fo ##ne announced a 1 ##. ##3 per cent rise in revenues to £ 46 ##. ##4 ##b ##n for the 12 months to March 31 , while pre ##- ##ta ##x profit was flat at £ 9 ##. ##5 ##b ##n , with a £ 4 ##b ##n imp ##air ##ment charge for poor performance in rapidly weakening European markets .
Between July 2008 , when Mr Cola ##o became chief executive , and March 2012 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne delivered total shareholder return of 45 ##. ##8 per cent , a £ 14 ##. ##9 ##b ##n appreciation in market capital ##isation , with £ 19 ##. ##2 ##b ##n paid out in divide ##nds and £ 6 ##. ##7 ##b ##n in share buy ##backs .
unused ##1 The drop in spending by cash ##- ##stra ##pped consumers in southern Europe and tough ##er government regulation prompted the company to cut its medium ##- ##ter ##m revenue growth target by 1 percentage point to a range of 0 ##- ##3 per cent .
The story was different in the US where V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the mobile operator 45 per cent owned by V ##oda ##fo ##ne , reported service revenues up 7 ##. ##3 per cent year on year , contributing £ 4 ##. ##9 ##b ##n of profit to the British group .
In the 12 months to March 31 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported flat pre ##- ##ta ##x profit of £ 9 ##. ##5 ##b ##n from revenues up from £ 45 ##. ##8 ##b ##n to £ 46 ##. ##4 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 Di ##lut ##ed earnings per share fell from 15 ##. ##11 ##p to 13 ##. ##65 ##p , and a final divide ##nd of 6 ##. ##47 ##p was proposed , up from 6 ##. ##0 ##5 ##p , bringing the total pay ##out to shareholders for the year - including a 4 ##p special divide ##nd - to 13 ##. ##5 ##2 ##p , a rise of 51 ##. ##9 per cent from the previous year .
Mr Cola ##o refused to comment on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s £ 1 ##. ##0 ##4 ##b ##n bid for Cable & Wireless Worldwide , which has been called into doubt due to shareholder resistance to the deal .
Mr Cola ##o also took a s ##wi ##pe at the Indian authorities for pursuing V ##oda ##fo ##ne for $ 2 ##. ##6 ##b ##n in capital gains tax following its acquisition of a controlling stake in Hu ##tch ##ison E ##ssa ##r , an Indian mobile business , in 2007 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s board will today rat ##ify an extension of the mobile operator ' ##s aggressive share buy ##- ##back programme after re ##pur ##cha ##sing Pound ##s 56 ##4 ##. ##7 ##m of stock in the past eight weeks .
unused ##1 The company , which bought back Pound ##s 4 ##b ##n of shares last year , is expected to announce a continuation of the programme together with its full ##- ##ye ##ar results tomorrow .
unused ##1 Industry analysts are forecast ##ing a similar size re ##pur ##chase for the current financial year , but expectations of a rich ##er programme - perhaps reaching Pound ##s 4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n - have gathered pace following continued buy ##- ##backs in the current financial year .
Today ' ##s board meeting will also re ##af ##fi ##rm plans for a more generous divide ##nd pay ##- ##out as V ##oda ##fo ##ne prepares to announce underlying earnings up 2 ##. ##3 per cent at Pound ##s 12 ##. ##9 ##b ##n on sales of Pound ##s 34 ##b ##n , compared with Pound ##s 33 ##. ##6 ##b ##n last time .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts at Le ##hman Brothers are expecting the company to report about 1 ##. ##5 ##m 3 ##G subscribers at the end of March .
This could raise doubts about V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s target of reaching 10 ##m subscribers by the end of the current financial year .
unused ##1 The group has warned it could take up to 15 months to revive the business , and S ##G Equity Research warned of little improvement in sub ##s ##cribe ##r trends during April .
In spite of these problems , there , V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s pre ##- ##ta ##x profits are expected to rise modest ##ly from Pound ##s 10 ##b ##n to Pound ##s 10 ##. ##2 ##b ##n with the total number of subscribers likely to rise about 10 per cent this year from the 151 ##. ##8 ##m total at the end of last year .
unused ##1 Given the group ' ##s estimated free cash flow of almost Pound ##s 7 ##b ##n , A ##run Sa ##rin , chief executive , has promised increased divide ##nds and buy backs as a tool to reward shareholders .
unused ##1 The F ##TS ##E 100 company yesterday cut its medium ##- ##ter ##m revenue growth target for the current financial year by 1 percentage point to between 0 per cent and 3 per cent .
In the 12 months to March 31 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported flat pre ##- ##ta ##x profit of £ 9 ##. ##5 ##b ##n on a 1 ##. ##2 per cent rise in revenues to £ 46 ##. ##4 ##b ##n .
However , investors pushed up V ##oda ##fo ##ne shares 4 ##. ##3 per cent to 172 ##p thanks to a proposed 52 per cent jump in the group ' ##s full ##- ##ye ##ar divide ##nd to 13 ##. ##5 ##2 ##p , and a strong performance in the US .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the US mobile operator 45 per cent owned by V ##oda ##fo ##ne , reported service revenues up 7 ##. ##3 per cent year on year and contributed £ 4 ##. ##9 ##b ##n to the group ' ##s bottom line .
Mr Cola ##o   took a s ##wi ##pe at the Indian government ' ##s fresh efforts to p ##rise $ 2 ##. ##6 ##b ##n in capital gains tax from V ##oda ##fo ##ne over its 2007 acquisition of a controlling stake in Hu ##tch ##ison E ##ssa ##r .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless , in which V ##oda ##fo ##ne has a 45 per cent stake , is widely expected to resume paying divide ##nds in 2012 to break the s ##tale ##mate between its parent companies .

W ##S Atkins lost 2 ##. ##2 per cent to 77 ##5 ##p on an RB ##S down ##grade from " buy " to " hold " .
B ##HP Bill ##ito ##n , the world ' ##s biggest mine ##r , surprised investors with plans to return Dollar ##s 10 ##b ##n ( Pound ##s 5 ##. ##1 ##b ##n ) in share buy ##- ##backs and search for a new chief executive after the incumbent Chip Good ##ye ##ar said he planned ##to leave at the end of ##the year .

B ##HP reported a 41 per cent jump in first ##- ##hal ##f net profit to Dollar ##s 6 ##. ##17 ##b ##n ( Dollar ##s 4 ##. ##36 ##b ##n ) on higher metal prices and said China would continue as the main driver of demand for raw materials .
unused ##1 Jason Fair ##c ##lough , mining analyst at Merrill Lynch , said the first ##- half earnings were about ##3 per cent below estimates .
As with rival Rio Tin ##to , which last week reported a 25 per cent gain in half ##- ##ye ##ar profit to Dollar ##s 3 ##. ##5 ##9 ##b ##n , B ##HP ' ##s base metals division and petroleum unit made a weight ##y contribution .
B ##HP , which has 29 projects worth Dollar ##s 17 ##. ##5 ##b ##n in construction or at the f ##eas ##ibility stage , increased its first ##- ##hal ##f divide ##nd 14 per cent to 20 cents .
Liberty Global , which has net debt of about $ ##40 ##b ##n and a market capital ##isation of more than $ ##30 ##b ##n , would be a dig ##est ##ible deal for V ##oda ##fo ##ne post a V ##eri ##zon stake sale and one which would significantly decrease its appeal as a takeover target , analysts said .

P ##lum ##bing specialist W ##ols ##eley rose 0 ##. ##7 per cent to Pound ##s 11 ##. ##48 , helped by forecast ##- ##beat ##ing figures from Travis Perkins - all the more unexpected after a profit warning from the builders ' merchant at the end of last year .
Ka ##zak ##hm ##ys was protected from the worst of the falls in the mining sector , ending down 0 ##. ##2 per cent at Pound ##s 12 ##. ##4 ##9 , as a sharp jump in production prompted Credit Su ##isse to raise its price target from Pound ##s 13 to Pound ##s 15 .
While online gaming stocks suffered another shake ##- ##out - Party ##G ##ami ##ng fell 3 ##. ##4 per cent to 105 3 ##/ ##4 ##p and 88 ##8 Holdings lost 7 ##. ##7 per cent to 143 ##p - William Hill edged up 0 ##. ##4 per cent to 59 ##3 1 ##/ ##2 ##p as C ##iti ##group upgraded it to " buy " and said it could yet be a target for a private equity buyer .
Body ##cote International rose 4 ##. ##5 per cent to 237 ##p as Credit Su ##isse lifted its rating on the industrial heat treatment specialist from " neutral " to " out ##per ##form " with a 290 ##p target price .
unused ##1 The first was in January when he delivered the group ' ##s first profit warning in 20 years , wiping pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##b ##n off its market capital ##isation .
There was no second profit warning , but Te ##sco managed to mess up the announcement of its divide ##nd - confusing the total with the final divide ##nd - a lack of professional ##ism that it is difficult to imagine occurring under former chief executive Sir Terry Leah ##y .
unused ##1 In the UK , trading profit , which exclude ##s profits from property and exceptional items , fell 1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##48 ##b ##n in the year to February 25 , compared with the same period a year previously , and sales from stores open at least a year fell 1 ##. ##2 per cent in the second half compared with the year earlier .

But B ##HP Bill ##ito ##n , the world ' ##s largest mine ##r , pleased investors yesterday by delivering a final divide ##nd of 41 cents a share , giving a total of 82 cents for the year to June 30 .
B ##HP is looking increasingly able to handle the disastrous market conditions , more so than rivals such as Anglo American or X ##stra ##ta , which have suspended their divide ##nds until further notice as they struggle with high debt levels .
Alone among its UK mining peers , B ##HP has a petroleum division , whose operating profits of $ ##4 ##b ##n made it the group ' ##s third most valuable division during the year after iron ore , which had operating profits of $ ##6 ##. ##23 ##b ##n , and base metals with $ ##4 ##. ##6 ##2 ##b ##n ##.
It was a test ##ament to the worst year in the mining sector ' ##s living memory that B ##HP ' ##s annual profits , which on a pre ##- ##ta ##x basis fell 50 per cent to $ ##11 ##. ##6 ##b ##n , were hailed by analysts as a solid , expectation ##- ##beat ##ing performance .

In the six months to June 30 , Anglo and X ##stra ##ta both recorded pre ##- ##ta ##x profits p ##lung ##ing by close to 70 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar .

Rudy Mark ##ham is to retire as chief financial officer at Un ##ile ##ver , continuing a series of high ##- ##p ##ro ##fi ##le board changes at the Anglo ##- Dutch consumer goods group that reported disappointing sales figures with its annual results .

Un ##ile ##ver reported underlying sales growth of 3 ##. ##8 per cent for the full year .

unused ##1 Sales over Christmas and the New Year were unusually bad and Mr Clarke ' ##s Big Price Drop initiative failed to bring in the punt ##ers .
Te ##sco ' ##s pre ##- ##ta ##x profit last year rose more than 5 per cent and its operating margin went up as well .

Most importantly , perhaps , for investors , despite recent t ##ra ##va ##ils , Te ##sco ' ##s divide ##nd also went up as well .

Moody ' ##s puts Te ##sco under review after profit warning
Moody ' ##s , the credit rating agency , has placed Te ##sco ' ##s A ##3 long ##- ##ter ##m senior un ##se ##cure ##d rating under review for possible down ##grade , following the retailer ' ##s shock profit warning last week .
Moody ' ##s said yesterday that the review followed Te ##sco ' ##s weak performance in its home market over the crucial Christmas and new year trading period , and the warning that underlying profits in the 2012 ##- ##13 financial year would be lower than expected .
unused ##1 " The company ' ##s recent investment in price promotions has not had the anticipated impact on volume growth .
unused ##1 " More significantly , however , Moody ' ##s believes that the company ' ##s revised forecast for profit growth suggests that the credit metric ##s may not improve to the extent that had previously been expected for the A ##3 rating and stable outlook , " the rating agency said yesterday .
However , it said that , more positively , Te ##sco had not altered its year ##- ##end net debt forecast of pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##4 ##b ##n , while capital expenditure could be lowered through Te ##sco curb ##ing its expansion plans , primarily through out of town h ##yper ##market ##s .

unused ##1 The grocery chain recorded like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 8 ##. ##1 per cent , excluding petrol , and announced it would buy 38 stores from the Co ##- ##oper ##ative Group as it invested in expansion .
The trading update , which beat analysts ' expectations , followed an an ##ae ##mic performance by Te ##sco , the UK ' ##s biggest retailer , which this week reported 2 per cent like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth during its third quarter and g ##amble ##d on winning over cash ##- ##stra ##pped customers with its " discount brands " strategy .
unused ##1 " Once again we have grown our like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales well ahead of the market , " he said .
Morrison ' ##s total sales in the 13 weeks to November 2 rose 14 ##. ##9 per cent , or 9 ##. ##5 per cent excluding fuel .
The move is the first big expansion by Morrison since it acquired Safe ##way in 2004 , a deal that took longer than expected to integrate successfully .
Morrison added it would now cu ##rta ##il its planned share buy ##- ##back to finance the pound ##( ##s ##) ##40 ##3 ##m of investments .
Te ##sco said yesterday it was feeling the effects of the consumer slow ##down in its home market as Britain ' ##s biggest retail chain failed to match up to sales expectations .
Te ##sco said conditions had been more difficult over Christmas , but the 3 ##. ##1 per cent lift in underlying sales - against expectations of 4 ##- ##4 ##. ##5 per cent - in the six weeks to January 5 was a credible effort .
unused ##1 He said central Europe , where Christmas is widely celebrated , delivered a 30 per cent sales up ##lift .
unused ##1 Overall the international business , which now accounts for nearly a quarter of group sales and a fifth of profits , enjoyed sales growth of 26 ##. ##9 per cent .

First , Te ##sco is adding more space , with 600 ##, ##00 ##0 sq ft opened in the first half , helping Te ##sco lift total sales 11 ##. ##1 per cent to Pound ##s 14 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ##.
Te ##sco thinks there is lots of potential to expand the operation , which lifted sales by 31 per cent to Pound ##s 401 ##m in the first half .
One analyst estimates that between 2 and 3 per cent of Te ##sco ' ##s underlying sales growth since July 2004 - including petrol where sales have been up more than 8 per cent - has come on the back of competitor weakness , given that Te ##sco ' ##s typical underlying growth sits in the region of 5 to 6 per cent .
Meanwhile , if Te ##sco is feeling the effects of cost pressures on a profit of Pound ##s 90 ##8 ##m , it will certainly be taking its toll on Morrison and Sai ##ns ##bury , with the former heading for a heavy loss this year , while the latter only scraped a profit in the year to May .

During the three months to the end of September , revenues jumped 17 per cent to $ ##15 ##. ##1 ##b ##n , driven by strong sales in Latin America and the Asia ##- ##P ##ac ##ific region that offset decline ##s in the US and Europe and allowed Dow to increase its prices by 17 per cent .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne generated revenue of pound ##( ##s ##) ##10 ##. ##5 ##b ##n in the three months to December 31 , up 14 ##. ##3 per cent , largely because of favourable exchange rate movements .
On an underlying basis , revenue fell 1 per cent in the company ' ##s third quarter , partly because V ##oda ##fo ##ne is selling fewer mobile phones in the economic down ##turn .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s UK , Italian and German businesses recorded improving revenue trends in the third quarter .
However , V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s Spanish business saw its revenue fall by 5 ##. ##8 per cent compared with the same period in 2007 ##- ##0 ##8 .
The picture was even worse at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s Turkish business , where revenue fell by 14 ##. ##5 per cent .
A price war between Indian mobile operators means V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported lower revenue growth of 30 per cent in the third quarter .
However , V ##oda ##fo ##ne highlighted how the increase in net debt was more than offset by the rise in value of the company ' ##s international assets .
Un ##ile ##ver shares dipped after the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch consumer goods conglomerate said underlying sales in the developed world fell in the first quarter .
Un ##ile ##ver , which only gave turnover numbers for the first quarter , said : " The markets for our input materials remain volatile . . . leading to further upward pressure on prices .

unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported a record pre ##- ##ta ##x loss of Pound ##s 14 ##. ##9 ##b ##n for 2006 , and warned of slowing revenue growth , lower profit margins and reduced free cash flow in 2007 .

unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne saw core profit , based on its preferred measure of earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation , increase by 7 per cent to Pound ##s 11 ##. ##8 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 The record pre ##- ##ta ##x loss was caused primarily by a Pound ##s 23 ##. ##5 ##b ##n write ##- ##down of assets and resulted in a basic loss per share of 27 ##. ##7 ##p ##.
unused ##1 " However , we . . . remain s ##ce ##ptic ##al on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s ability to realise its earnings potential . "
V ##oda ##fo ##ne is braced for investors holding about 10 per cent of its shares to vote against Mr Sa ##rin ' ##s re ##- ##ele ##ction at the company ' ##s annual meeting today , but he insisted he had the right strategy to reverse slowing revenue growth .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s challenges in Europe were under ##lined yesterday with the publication of better than expected group revenue figures for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year .
unused ##1 It reported revenue growth of 9 ##. ##2 per cent against the first quarter of 2006 .
unused ##1 But year ##- on ##- ##ye ##ar revenue growth in Europe was 0 ##. ##5 per cent , compared with 62 ##. ##2 per cent in emerging markets .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne added a total of 16 ##. ##2 ##m customers in the quarter , after acquisitions , taking the total to 186 ##. ##8 ##m ##.

In May V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported a record pre ##- ##ta ##x loss of Pound ##s 14 ##. ##9 ##b ##n for 2006 .
Some investors are also expected to vent their anger at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s plans to lower the earnings growth targets that management must hit for share option awards .
A ##run Sa ##rin yesterday sought to di ##sp ##el fears about slowing revenue growth at V ##oda ##fo ##ne by saying the mobile phone company would make more acquisitions in Africa and Asia .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s guidance implies revenue growth of 5 ##. ##6 per cent on a like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like basis in 2008 ##- ##0 ##9 , down from 6 ##. ##6 per cent in 2007 ##- ##0 ##8 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne lifted overall revenue by 14 ##. ##1 per cent to L ##35 ##. ##5 ##b ##n in the year to the end of March .
unused ##1 From this , it made a pre ##- ##ta ##x profit of L ##9 ##b ##n , compared with a loss of L ##2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n in 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 .
It was V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s warning of slowing growth and declining profit margins in 2005 that almost cost Mr Sa ##rin his job the following year .
A US regulator could delay the proposed Barclay ##s ' Euro ##s 3 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ( Dollar ##s 4 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ) share buy ##- ##back unveiled yesterday as part of the UK bank ' ##s revised offer for AB ##N Am ##ro .

unused ##1 Andrew Higgins ##on , finance director , defended the 3 ##. ##1 per cent rise in UK underlying sales as a good performance and rejected concerns that Britain ' ##s shop ##pers were falling out of love with their biggest retail chain .
unused ##1 But underlying sales growth of 3 ##. ##1 per cent in the six weeks to January 5 was less than the 4 ##. ##1 per cent of Wait ##rose in a similar period .
It was also below the 3 ##. ##7 per cent growth for J . Sai ##ns ##bury in the 12 weeks to December 29 .
Mr Higgins ##on said a comparison with Sai ##ns ##bury was unfair since Te ##sco ' ##s rival ' ##s figure covered a longer period and , for the early part of it , Te ##sco had seen a 4 per cent sales gain .
unused ##1 Mr Higgins ##on said the group as a whole had lifted sales 12 ##. ##8 per cent in the six weeks .
unused ##1 The international business performed better than the UK , with sales over the f ##estive season up 26 ##. ##9 per cent .

Slow ##ing growth in China contributed to a sharp decline in sales for drinks group Per ##no ##d Rica ##rd .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne has a 45 per cent stake in V ##eri ##zon Wireless , but has not received a divide ##nd since 2005 .
V ##eri ##zon Communications , the US te ##le ##com ##s group and controlling shareholder at V ##eri ##zon Wireless , has been blocking divide ##nd payments in an apparent attempt to squeeze out V ##oda ##fo ##ne .
Mr Sa ##rin , meanwhile , will be under pressure to show rapid progress on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s new strategy to deal with slowing revenue growth by cutting costs and getting customers to make greater use of mobile ##s in their homes .

Te ##sco ' ##s recovery path to start with sales dip
Te ##sco ' ##s UK underlying sales are set to fall in the first quarter , despite chief executive Philip Clarke ' ##s recovery plan for the retailer ' ##s domestic business .
unused ##1 In April , Mr Clarke set out a strategic blue ##print for Britain ' ##s biggest supermarket chain by market share after its first profit warning in 20 years .
However , City analysts still forecast a decline in sales from Te ##sco UK stores open at least a year when the retailer reports on June 11 .

This compares with a 1 ##. ##6 per cent drop in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the fourth quarter to the end of February , although it is an improvement on the 2 ##. ##3 per cent decline over Christmas and the new year , Te ##sco ' ##s worst performance for decades .
Mr Black said the first ##- ##qua ##rter performance would be in line with expectations , as Te ##sco was just starting to implement the changes Mr Clarke talked about in April , such as putting more staff into supermarket ##s and introducing improved ready meals .
unused ##1 " We would not be expecting Te ##sco to be doing anything other than performing in line with the fourth quarter , slightly under ##per ##form ##ing the industry .
unused ##1 " While we think there probably has been some underlying sales improvement , aided by the very high level of money ##- ##off coup ##ons , we think April was weak [ impacted by the weather ] and the calendar will not un ##wind until the second quarter , " said Mr Ka ##so ##uli ##s in a note .

unused ##1 Bernstein Research has pencil ##led in operating profits of pound ##( ##s ##) ##26 ##3 ##m , or 10 per cent of the UK operating profit , for the year to March .
Results in Te ##sco ' ##s international business - Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities expects revenues to be 13 ##. ##4 per cent higher at pound ##( ##s ##) ##18 ##. ##3 ##b ##n - will be mixed , with continental Europe hard hit .
unused ##1 Shore Capital expects profits there , given the struggles of economies such as the Irish Republic and Hungary , to be down 10 per cent .

Nine months into a plan to overhaul the UK business and one year after its profit warning , Te ##sco ' ##s Christmas sales figures look relatively under ##w ##hel ##ming .
unused ##1 In the six weeks to January 5 , group like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales excluding petrol were up 0 ##. ##3 per cent .
unused ##1 UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales , excluding petrol and strip ##ping out sales from Club ##card v ##ou ##chers , were broadly in line with expectations , rising 1 ##. ##4 per cent , boost ##ed by better food and online sales .
But broker Seymour Pierce points out that this is a poor return considering Te ##sco has invested 1 per cent of its tight margin this financial year to achieve it , following a profit warning a year ago after the group ' ##s dire performance at Christmas 2011 .
Like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in Asia and central Europe continued to decline , while in the US , where Te ##sco is reviewing its Fresh & Easy business , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales fell 2 ##. ##1 per cent .
As its 10 per cent increase in first half profits yesterday showed , Te ##sco is about as safe as things come in these uncertain , paranoid times .
unused ##1 UK underlying sales growth of 3 ##. ##7 per cent la ##gs behind more price ##- ##ori ##ent ##ated competitors such as Morrison ##s and W ##al ##- ##M ##art ' ##s As ##da , even if the threat from " deep " discount ##ers such as Al ##di is exaggerated .
Te ##sco ' ##s 4 per cent higher non ##- ##food sales came from a significant , un ##sp ##ec ##ified , space rise ##- meaning sales den ##sities fell .
unused ##1 International ##ly , sales growth of 1 per cent from stores open at least a year is under ##w ##hel ##ming , given the amount of space added .
unused ##1 Under ##lying sales were flat last year and profit margins declined slightly .
Success overseas is patch ##y ( the US business is still bleeding cash ; the Chinese one has not broken even as quickly as Te ##sco expected ) but overall trading profit rose 11 per cent in Europe and 30 per cent in Asia .
Te ##sco ' ##s net debt is not that large , but capital expenditure is high .
unused ##1 The divide ##nd pay ##out works out at only about a third of that but , as promised last year , the 11 per cent increase in the interim divide ##nd is in line with earnings growth , boost ##ed by profits from property sales .
These reached Pound ##s 74 ##m in the first half and are expected to continue a ##pace , as Te ##sco reduces the amount of property it owns from 85 per cent to about 70 per cent of its portfolio .
unused ##1 The group ' ##s share buy ##- ##back programme is now running , though the Pound ##s 1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n targeted over the next five years is ins ##ign ##ificant in the context of the company ' ##s near Pound ##s 30 ##b ##n capital ##isation .
unused ##1 Still , a divide ##nd yield approaching 2 ##. ##8 per cent this year seems acceptable for a company investing heavily in growth opportunities .
unused ##1 In the UK , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth in the second quarter of 6 ##. ##6 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar looks roughly in line , rather than ahead of competitors .
unused ##1 Yesterday ' ##s first ##- ##hal ##f results were at ##ro ##cious , with profits for the UK company down in almost all areas of the business .
unused ##1 The rate of decline in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales slowed in the second quarter against the first - from 1 ##. ##1 per cent to 0 ##. ##8 per cent - as a turn ##rou ##nd plan that involves back ##- ##to ##- ##bas ##ics wisdom such as low prices , more welcoming stores and higher staff ##ing took effect .
unused ##1 That is a decent start but it can not yet be counted as evidence that January ' ##s profit warning was a b ##lip rather than the start of a long , Carr ##ef ##our ##- ##style decline .
On 10 times forecast earnings , Te ##sco is at a discount to the likes of Sai ##ns ##bury ( 12 ) and W ##al ##mart ( 14 ) .
But Te ##sco is no longer the growth story it once was and bargain hunters should hold off until there is more evidence of a recovery than one quarter of improvement in like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales numbers .
unused ##1 The UK business , its main earnings engine , increased trading profit by 5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##3 ##b ##n on sales 6 per cent higher .
unused ##1 Strip out the effect of new stores , however , and sales excluding petrol and value added tax fell by 0 ##. ##5 per cent , mostly in the second quarter .
The outlook is g ##loom ##ier : Te ##sco predict ##s flat profit in the second half from a year ago .
Te ##sco ' ##s Asian and European operations , where first ##- ##hal ##f trading profit rose 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively , should continue to ease the pain .
unused ##1 Group trading profit , which rose by 3 ##. ##7 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , would have been 4 ##. ##5 percentage points higher without a pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##7 ##m one ##- ##off provision for personal protection insurance mi ##s ##- ##sel ##ling claims .
Te ##sco has little to show for the pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n it has spent in the US , other than pound ##( ##s ##) ##80 ##0 ##m of accumulated losses and a 200 ##- ##sto ##re estate that struggled to attract shop ##pers .
unused ##1 With the core UK business struggling ( like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the UK fell 1 ##. ##2 per cent in the third quarter ) , the company is becoming increasingly f ##rug ##al and picking its targets far more carefully .
Te ##sco ' ##s lack ##lus ##tre UK sales growth is concerning when competitors J Sai ##ns ##bury ( expected to report b ##uo ##yan ##t figures today ) and W ##m Morrison have accelerated like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like growth through the recession .
Deep discount ##ers ' market share gains have ground to a halt , and with the anniversary of discount brands ' launch now passed , Te ##sco says its UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth has " con ##ver ##ged with the industry " .
Prof ##it growth was also tempered by higher interest costs after Te ##sco acquired Korea ' ##s Home ##ver chain for pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##5 ##8 ##m and bought out Royal Bank of Scotland ' ##s 50 per cent share in their financial services joint venture for pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##50 ##m last year .
International sales - now one ##- ##thi ##rd of Te ##sco ' ##s total - should accelerate as markets in central Europe and Asia pull out of the do ##ld ##rum ##s .
unused ##1 Food & DR ##U ##G Re ##tail ##ers ; Group says it is catching UK rivals ; International sales b ##uo ##y first quarter
Te ##sco insisted it was narrowing the gap on faster ##- ##gro ##wing UK rivals W ##m Morrison , J Sai ##ns ##bury and As ##da , as international sales b ##uo ##yed its first ##- ##qua ##rter performance .
The comments come ahead of first ##- ##qua ##rter figures today from Sai ##ns ##bury , which are expected to reveal a 6 ##. ##4 per cent increase in like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales .
unused ##1 De ##mand for non ##- ##food items was also picking up , with " modest " like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth re ##suming in recent weeks .
unused ##1 Group sales for the 13 weeks to May 30 rose 9 ##. ##7 per cent including petrol , and 12 ##. ##6 per cent excluding such sales .
International sales rose 20 ##. ##1 per cent , or 11 ##. ##4 per cent at constant exchange rates , boost ##ed by Asian markets , but held back by Ireland where Te ##sco has been trying to stem the flow of cross ##- ##bor ##der shop ##pers seeking bargain ##s in Northern Ireland .
Sales in the US - where Te ##sco has been forced to slow its expansion plans - almost triple ##d , although Mr M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e acknowledged that the US operation was an " im ##mat ##ure and small business " .
Te ##sco ' ##s personal finance operation contributed 2 ##. ##2 percentage points to overall UK sales growth of 9 ##. ##3 per cent .
unused ##1 " The customer count is increasing steadily , " said Mr M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e .
Second , price ##- ##led formats are thriving - Al ##di , the German ##- ##own ##ed discount ##er , says total UK sales rose 22 per cent in December .
unused ##1 The step ##- ##up in its Christmas sales from the previous quarter suggests the initiative is paying off - and could start den ##ting the currently superior performance of rival supermarket groups Sai ##ns ##bury , W ##m Morrison , and W ##al ##- ##M ##art ' ##s As ##da .
Te ##sco led the wider market lower after reporting weaker than expected non ##- ##food sales over Christmas .
Dixon ##s Re ##tail also blamed the pre ##- ##C ##hr ##ist ##mas snow for a profit warning , sending its shares down 10 per cent to 21 1 ##/ ##4 p ##.
But A ##rgo ##s owner Home Re ##tail Group bounced 10 ##. ##2 per cent to 227 ##p amid short covering after its holiday sales proved better than feared .
Car ins ##urer Admiral Group took on 2 ##. ##9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##15 ##. ##6 ##9 , helped by " buy " advice from Red ##burn Partners .
unused ##1 So much for record Pound ##s 2 ##b ##n profit , gang ##buster sales growth and a market share above 30 per cent .
However , most analysts expect underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 per cent , which would be up to Pound ##s 900 ##m more than Te ##sco officially budget ##ed for .
unused ##1 Some already have their eye on Pound ##s 3 ##b ##n in profit in coming years .
Boots , which last week reported a 11 ##. ##4 per cent decline in profit before exceptional ##s to Pound ##s 48 ##1 ##m , is one of the many retailers that has been hit by the march of supermarket ##s into the health and beauty market .

According to industry data from Ka ##nta ##r World ##pan ##el , the consumer research group , Te ##sco experienced stronger than expected sales growth over the past four weeks .
unused ##1 In the four weeks to November 25 , sales through Te ##sco ' ##s till ##s rose 2 ##. ##7 per cent year on year , ahead of the market at 2 ##. ##5 per cent , and making it the fastest growing of the so ##- ##cal ##led big four supermarket ##s .
Te ##sco ' ##s grocery sales rose 5 ##. ##2 per cent in the four weeks to November 25 , according to Ka ##nta ##r , compared with the market at 3 ##. ##1 per cent , indicating that the retailer ' ##s performance is being dragged down by sales of non ##- ##food items .
unused ##1 The brighter picture comes ahead of today ' ##s third ##- ##qua ##rter update , when it is forecast to report flat to slightly negative sales growth for the three months to the end of November .
This is a slow ##down from the second quarter , when Te ##sco had its first rise in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales for two years , up 0 ##. ##1 per cent in the three months to the end of August .
Ana ##ly ##sts at Deutsche Bank , joint broker to Te ##sco , forecast a 0 ##. ##8 per cent decline in Te ##sco ' ##s UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the third quarter , driven mostly by weakness in non ##- ##food , while Shore Capital forecast ##s flat sales to a 1 per cent decline .
unused ##1 However , Dave McCarthy , analyst at In ##ves ##tec Securities , said it was possible Te ##sco ' ##s sales could be better than forecast , as recent trading will have been " flat ##tered by the timing and nature of promotions " .
Te ##sco is also facing head ##wind ##s from overseas , with like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in its loss ##making US business forecast to rise by 4 ##- ##5 per cent , according to Shore Capital .
unused ##1 This would be only marginal ##ly ahead of the 3 ##. ##6 per cent increase in the first quarter , regarded as disappointing by the market .
While Te ##sco experienced better trading in the past four weeks , sales growth slowed at J Sai ##ns ##bury , from 5 ##. ##3 per cent in October to 1 ##. ##4 per cent in November .
Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s grocery sales rose by 1 per cent .
W ##m Morrison sales fell 1 ##. ##7 per cent in November , according to Ka ##nta ##r .
In a year pepper ##ed with job losses , profit warnings and missed targets , Te ##sco managed to b ##uck the wider ma ##lai ##se in the retail ##ing sector and provided the high point of 2005 when it became the first UK retailer to break the Pound ##s 2 ##b ##n profit barrier .
R ##ival W ##m Morrison ' ##s w ##oes were some of the most prominent stories of the year ##as the UK ' ##s fourth ##- ##lar ##ges ##t supermarket struggled with the integration of its Pound ##s 3 ##. ##3 ##b ##n acquisition of Safe ##way in March 2004 .
unused ##1 The Bradford ##- ##base ##d retailer , led by 74 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Sir Ken Morrison , g ##rap ##pled with four profit warnings in a few months as the management team was forced to admit its internal accounting team could not cope with the enlarged business .

Te ##sco chief cautious despite store ' ##s pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##1 ##b ##n record profit
In the midst of the worst recession of a generation , Sir Terry Leah ##y proved his ca ##li ##bre once again yesterday as he over ##came the obvious obstacles to deliver yet another year of record profits and growth at Te ##sco .
unused ##1 Against the backdrop of a global down ##turn , trading profit rose 8 ##. ##8 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##1 ##b ##n ( $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ) .
As consumers across many of Te ##sco ' ##s 14 markets tighten their belts , it lifted group sales by 13 ##. ##5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##60 ##b ##n .
Even in the UK , where Te ##sco ' ##s underlying sales growth of 3 per cent for the year is clearly la ##gging rivals W ##m Morrison and As ##da , Sir Terry still turned in a best ##- ##in ##- ##c ##lass trading margin of 6 ##. ##2 per cent , helped by some craft ##y cost ##- ##cut ##ting ( to the tune of pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##40 ##m in the past financial year ) .
unused ##1 First , the retailer ' ##s net debt has balloon ##ed to pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##. ##6 ##b ##n from pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##2 ##b ##n in the past year .
Instead of breaking even this year , Te ##sco is now looking at another year of losses .
Having committed to invest up to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##25 ##b ##n in the chain in the five years to 2012 , Fresh & Easy , rack ##ed up another pound ##( ##s ##) ##14 ##0 ##m of losses this year .
Philip Clarke , chief executive of Te ##sco , claimed an early victory in his pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n battle to turn round Te ##sco ' ##s UK business after a profit warning a year ago , as he confirmed a re ##shu ##ffle of his top team .
unused ##1 The retailer said UK sales rose 1 ##. ##8 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the six weeks to January 5 , on a " like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like " basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and the VA ##T sales tax .
The Christmas trading figures were much better than Te ##sco ' ##s dire performance over the same six ##- ##week period a year earlier , when it posted a like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales decline of 2 ##. ##3 per cent in the UK .
unused ##1 That set ##back prompted the group ' ##s first profit warning in two decades and a subsequent commitment to invest pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n in turning round the UK business .
He said Te ##sco had been gal ##vani ##sed to produce a better performance after the shock of the profit warning last year .
Te ##sco said like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in Europe fell 3 ##. ##6 per cent , and 2 ##. ##1 per cent in the US .

unused ##1 Philip Clarke , chief executive of Te ##sco , issued an ul ##ti ##mat ##um to Fresh & Easy , its struggling US business , as he unveiled the retailer ' ##s first fall in pre ##- ##ta ##x profits for almost 20 years .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke , who also reported Te ##sco ' ##s first increase in under ##- ##lying UK sales for almost two years , said Fresh & Easy needed to " persuade " him it had a future with the group .
He said Fresh & Easy had " stumbled " in the first half , disappointing with losses of pound ##( ##s ##) ##7 ##4 ##m , broadly the same as last year .
Mr Clarke ' ##s comments came as a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n investment to turn round Te ##sco ' ##s UK business , plus a decline in international earnings , cut group pre ##- ##ta ##x profits by 12 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##6 ##6 ##b ##n in the six months to August 25 , the first fall for 18 years .
unused ##1 However , Mr Clarke was able to point to some improvement in the UK , which in January was the source of the group ' ##s first profit warning in 20 years . .
unused ##1 Sales from UK stores open at least a year rose 0 ##. ##1 per cent in the second quarter , excluding fuel and value added tax , against a 1 ##. ##5 per cent decline in the first quarter and a 2 ##. ##3 per cent fall over the crucial Christmas and New Year period .
However , this was overs ##had ##owed by J Sai ##ns ##bury , which reported better than expected like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 1 ##. ##9 per cent , excluding fuel and VA ##T .
Te ##sco was hit by falling earnings in the UK , Europe and Asia , after regulatory changes in South Korea , its biggest business outside its home market .

Te ##sco under ##lined its UK strength yesterday when the nation ' ##s biggest retail chain reported a 5 ##. ##9 per cent rise in underlying sales over the Christmas period , helped by strong demand for organic food , cash ##mere sweater ##s and flat ##- ##screen television ##s .

Te ##sco yesterday batted off the trading w ##oes be ##sett ##ing the high street as Britain ' ##s biggest supermarket group reported a strong rise in first ##- ##qua ##rter sales .
unused ##1 The strong performance puts Te ##sco on track to increase its profits by more than Pound ##s 300 ##m this year , which is the same amount of profit that J Sai ##ns ##bury , its nearest quoted competitor , is set to make , according to Andrew Fowler , of house broker Merrill Lynch .

Te ##sco ' ##s international business , which accounted for one ##- ##fi ##ft ##h of Te ##sco ' ##s Pound ##s 37 ##. ##1 ##b ##n sales last year , was also " performing well " , with underlying sales up 5 ##. ##5 per cent .

Te ##sco showed yesterday it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as the UK ' ##s biggest retailer reported the first slow ##down in underlying sales growth for two years .
unused ##1 Andy Higgins ##on , finance director , said the 5 ##. ##5 per cent rise in underlying sales in the 14 weeks to November 19 - against 6 ##. ##6 per cent in the previous quarter - was " very strong " when taken against the retailer ' ##s " longer ##- ##ter ##m historical performance " .
Andrew Fowler , analyst at Merrill Lynch , yesterday kept his full ##- year pre ##- ##ta ##x profit forecast unchanged at Pound ##s 2 ##. ##16 ##b ##n , adding : " There must have been some people who thought Sir Terry was just talking Te ##sco down .
unused ##1 " That 5 ##. ##5 per cent rise ( in underlying sales ) is twice the size of Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s ( growth ) , " said Mr Fowler .
unused ##1 Overall sales in the UK rose 11 ##. ##6 per cent , against 10 ##. ##9 in the previous quarter .
unused ##1 Growth in non ##- ##food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double ##- ##di ##git ##s .
unused ##1 He also said the international business was " slightly ahead " of expectations , with sales up 16 per cent at constant exchange rates .
Te ##sco forecast ##s UK sales re ##bound
Te ##sco , Britain ' ##s biggest supermarket chain by market share , is expected to move back into growth in its home market , when it reports sales figures this Tuesday , providing an early boost to new chief executive Philip Clarke .
unused ##1 JP ##M ##or ##gan C ##az ##eno ##ve , joint broker to Te ##sco , forecast ##s sales growth from UK stores open at least a year , excluding fuel and VA ##T , of 0 ##. ##5 ##- ##0 ##. ##6 per cent in the 13 weeks to May 28 .
unused ##1 This is an improvement on the final quarter of the 2010 ##- ##20 ##11 financial year , when like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales fell by 0 ##. ##7 per cent .
Te ##sco was the fastest growing of the big four supermarket ##s during the period , expanding sales by 10 ##. ##5 per cent .
J Sai ##ns ##bury is also due to report its first ##- ##qua ##rter sales on Wednesday .
unused ##1 Mr Black forecast ##s like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 1 ##. ##5 per cent to 2 per cent , excluding fuel but including VA ##T , also an improvement on the 1 per cent growth in the 10 weeks to March 19 .
unused ##1 The country ' ##s biggest retailer , which reported an unexpected slow ##down in sales growth in the past three months , said yesterday it was looking closely at whether to pass on the higher rate of VA ##T to customers .
S ##hare ##s in Te ##sco tumbled 2 ##. ##3 per cent to 425 ##. ##45 ##p after it reported UK sales growth from stores open at least a year of 2 ##. ##8 per cent , slightly below the consensus forecast of analysts poll ##ed by Re ##uters .
unused ##1 Total sales across the group rose 8 ##. ##8 per cent , excluding fuel .
unused ##1 The supermarket group has suffered several down ##grade ##s to profit forecast ##s as a result of restrictions imposed on big retailers ' store opening hours in South Korea , which are expected to hit its sales and profits .
These international pressures come at a delicate time for Te ##sco , which issued its first profit warning in 20 years in January after the worst performance from its UK business in decades .
unused ##1 JP ##M ##or ##gan C ##az ##eno ##ve and No ##mura , both broker ##s to Te ##sco , have each cut their forecast ##s of Te ##sco ' ##s pre ##- ##ta ##x profit this year , excluding property profits , by 2 per cent to about pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##5 ##b ##n - reflecting a pound ##( ##s ##) ##70 ##m reduction in profits from Korea .
unused ##1 Mr Black noted that the group faced other pressures outside its UK heart ##land , including a sharp slow ##down in sales growth at Fresh & Easy , its loss ##making US business .
He has cut his forecast of Te ##sco ' ##s pre ##- ##ta ##x profit excluding property profits this year by 5 ##. ##6 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##35 ##b ##n , to reflect lower expectations for Korea , the US , central Europe and the UK .
At the same time , Mr Black has raised his forecast of losses at Fresh & Easy by pound ##( ##s ##) ##13 ##m to pound ##( ##s ##) ##10 ##3 ##. ##3 ##m for this year .
unused ##1 With losses of pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##2 ##. ##3 ##m forecast for the year to February 2014 , this would take Fresh & Easy ' ##s cumulative losses to more than pound ##( ##s ##) ##80 ##0 ##m .
unused ##1 In 2012 , Mr Truman expects Te ##sco ' ##s overseas division to generate sales of Pound ##s 24 ##b ##n and earnings before interest and tax of Pound ##s 1 ##. ##23 ##b ##n ##.
To put that figure in context , J Sai ##ns ##bury and W ##m Morrison combined are expected to generate underlying earnings of just more than Pound ##s 1 ##b ##n in 2008 .
Morrison added 2 ##. ##8 per cent to 280 1 ##/ ##2 ##p after Deutsche Bank increased its target price to 335 ##p ahead of next Thursday ' ##s half ##- year figures .

ITV rose 4 ##. ##9 per cent to 75 ##. ##p ahead of a trading update due Wednesday , which analysts have forecast ##ed to be very weak due to a sharp decline in advertising sales over April .
" We believe ITV ' ##s current share price has already factor ##ed in the worse ##- ##than ##ex ##pect ##ed second quarter , " said JP ##M ##or ##gan C ##az ##eno ##ve .
unused ##1 The update " may be an opportunity to buy the stock as we believe the worse ##- ##than ##- ##ex ##pect ##ed second ##qua ##rter revenues for European free TV are not the sign of a structural change in the advertising recovery , but a b ##lip , " it said .

" Co ##bha ##m is the European defence company that is best addressing a shrink ##ing defence market , " said C ##iti ##group , which added the stock to its " buy " list .
unused ##1 Inter ##im results on Wednesday revived worries that the main drag on the retailer ' ##s earnings and cash flow was un ##p ##ro ##fit ##able expansion , rather than repair work following its profit warning in January .
But C ##iti blamed the earnings s ##lump on Te ##sco ' ##s expansion programme , which it said was creating " adverse sales leverage " .
Te ##sco closed 3 per cent lower at 31 ##8 ##. ##2 ##p , its sharp ##est fall since the January profit warning .
Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Hotels rose 1 ##. ##8 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##. ##6 ##9 after Mar ##riot ##t International ' ##s earnings beat forecast ##s , although the US group also tempered guidance for the current quarter on international weakness .
Half ##ord ##s jumped 14 ##. ##1 per cent to 303 ##. ##5 ##p after reporting its best like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in more than three years .

unused ##1 Group sales , excluding petrol , grew 10 ##. ##3 per cent in the 13 weeks to November , with UK sales up 8 ##. ##5 per cent .
unused ##1 At a group level , sales and profits in the six months to the end of August were all heading in the right direction , driven by a recovery in many of Te ##sco ' ##s international markets in central Europe and in Asia .
unused ##1 Indeed , Sir Terry was able to reveal a 12 ##. ##5 per cent increase in first ##- ##hal ##f pre ##- ##ta ##x profit to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##6 ##b ##n , on sales excluding VA ##T up 7 ##. ##1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##29 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , as economies recovered in Asia and Europe .

Loss ##es at Fresh & Easy , which will have about 165 stores after the moth ##ball ##ing , increased from pound ##( ##s ##) ##8 ##5 ##m to pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##5 ##m in the first half , reflecting the cost of acquiring the operations of two suppliers .
unused ##1 In the UK , sales from stores open at least a year , excluding VA ##T and petrol , rose 0 ##. ##3 per cent in the first half .
unused ##1 This was made up of 0 ##. ##1 per cent growth in the first quarter and 0 ##. ##4 per cent growth in the second .
unused ##1 He forecast ##s that rival J Sai ##ns ##bury will on Wednesday report first ##- ##hal ##f UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 1 ##. ##6 per cent .
Philip Clarke was in b ##uo ##yan ##t mood yesterday for a chief executive who has just announced the worst full ##- ##ye ##ar pre ##- ##ta ##x profit decline in Te ##sco ' ##s history .
unused ##1 In consequence , the sale ##- ##and ##- ##lea ##se ##backs that generated pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n in profits from the mid ##- ##19 ##90 ##s will no longer support earnings .
unused ##1 But Mr Clarke has at least attempted to con ##fine this to a range : mid single ##- ##di ##git trading profit growth delivering a return of 12 to 15 per cent on capital , which will be invested at a rate of 3 ##. ##5 to 4 per cent of sales .
Te ##sco poised to make profits history
Te ##sco is expected to make corporate history on Tuesday by being the first UK retailer to announce profits in excess of pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n , but celebrations are likely to be short ##- ##li ##ved , writes Samantha Pearson .
unused ##1 While the group remains Britain ' ##s biggest supermarket chain , it has been gradually losing market share in the down ##turn as its rivals lure customers with recession ##- ##friend ##ly discount ##s .
In ##ves ##tors will therefore be awaiting evidence in the full ##- ##ye ##ar results that Te ##sco ' ##s attempts to adapt its offering through monitoring customer spending have helped to maintain UK sales growth .
The other talking point will be Te ##sco ' ##s net debt , which although still manage ##able is likely to exceed the group ' ##s previous target of pound ##( ##s ##) ##8 ##b ##n and could stunt short ##- ##ter ##m store growth .
unused ##1 Te ##sco , however , is likely to reassure long ##- ##ter ##m investors with promising performance from its recent acquisition in South Korea and words of encouragement on its new initiative to introduce 30 in ##- ##sto ##re banks this year .
unused ##1 Pre ##- ##ta ##x profits are forecast at just more than pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n from expected revenues of pound ##( ##s ##) ##53 ##. ##5 ##b ##n , according to consensus analyst estimates from Thomson Re ##uters .
Since its profit warning in January , Te ##sco has set out to revive UK sales by investing in store re ##fit ##s , staff ##ing and improved product ranges .
B ##& ##Q owner King ##fish ##er lost 1 ##. ##8 per cent to 27 ##4 ##. ##9 ##p ahead of first ##- ##qua ##rter results due Thursday , which were widely expected to di ##sa ##pp ##oint because of in ##cle ##ment April weather .
" We expect like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the UK will be the worst King ##fish ##er has reported in at least the last decade , " said Bernstein Research .
Cap ##ita was up 3 per cent to 62 ##9 ##p after U ##BS added the outs ##our ##cer to its " buy " list .
unused ##1 Two years of declining organic revenue and increased acquisitions had weighed on returns and pushed the stock ' ##s v ##al ##uation to an all ##- ##time low , said U ##BS .
" We would expect Rex ##am to c ##lar ##ify the use of proceeds upon announcing the transaction , " said Merrill Lynch , which repeated " buy " advice .
" If we assume pound ##( ##s ##) ##25 ##0 ##m ##- ##30 ##0 ##m is returned , this e ##qua ##tes to 7 per cent - 9 per cent of the market capital ##isation , in addition to Rex ##am ' ##s recurring 3 ##. ##5 ##- ##4 ##. ##0 per cent divide ##nd yield . "
Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , is forecast ##ing losses from Fresh & Easy of about pound ##( ##s ##) ##80 ##m ( $ ##12 ##7 ##. ##4 ##m ) in the six months to August 22 .
Te ##sco will also be under pressure to show that its UK underlying sales performance is catching up with faster growing rivals , as it is la ##gging behind As ##da , J Sai ##ns ##bury and W ##m Morrison in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth .

In the last financial year , Te ##sco ' ##s online sales accounted for just less than two per cent - Pound ##s 57 ##7 ##m - of total group sales of Pound ##s 33 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ##.
But this year - Te ##sco announces its year ##- ##end results on April 12 - it is thought that the retailer ' ##s internet sales will have grown strongly after a b ##uo ##yan ##t ##C ##hr ##ist ##mas .
unused ##1 In the six months to August 14 online sales were up 27 per cent at Pound ##s 307 ##m , while pre ##- ##ta ##x profit was at Pound ##s 15 ##m .
That is double the annual sales of J ##S ##ain ##sbury and O ##ca ##do , the internet only retailer that sells Wait ##rose products , indicating the might of Te ##sco ' ##s online reach .
Te ##sco has been down ##graded by Moody ' ##s , the credit rating agency , just days after the retailer unveiled a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n recovery plan for its core UK business .
unused ##1 Moody ' ##s said it had cut Te ##sco ' ##s long ##- ##ter ##m senior un ##se ##cure ##d rating by one notch from A ##3 to Ba ##a ##1 because the pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n plan would weigh on earnings .
" It will take time for Te ##sco to re ##ap the benefits of the measures it has announced in order to revive profit growth in its key UK market to levels seen in previous years , especially in the current un ##fa ##vour ##able environment which will not support Te ##sco ' ##s sales growth , " said Ya ##sm ##ina Ser ##gh ##ini ##- ##D ##ou ##vin , senior analyst at Moody ##' ##s .
Te ##sco on Wednesday announced a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n plan for re ##vi ##ving its performance in the UK - which accounts for about two ##- ##thi ##rds of sales and profits - after making its first profit warning in 20 years in January .

Te ##sco sales fall despite pound ##( ##s ##) ##500 ##m in price cuts
The comments came as Te ##sco revealed that its programme of pound ##( ##s ##) ##500 ##m of price cuts launched in September had failed to improve sales at its UK stores that had been open for at least a year .

Te ##sco said that total sales rose by 8 ##. ##2 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 27 , driven by improvements both at home and overseas .
unused ##1 UK sales rose 5 per cent excluding fuel but including VA ##T .
unused ##1 Laurie M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e , finance director , said the performance strengthened throughout the quarter , with UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales up 2 ##. ##1 per cent , excluding fuel and VA ##T in the final four weeks .
unused ##1 Food price inflation was 0 ##. ##7 per cent lower in the third quarter than the second , and volumes were positive , he said .

Te ##sco shares climb on strong UK sales growth
S ##hare ##s in Te ##sco climbed to a record high yesterday as sales at the UK ' ##s largest retailer raced ahead in the third quarter , q ##ua ##shing earlier fears of a slow ##down in growth .

Ex ##c ##lu ##ding Japan , where Te ##sco made a second acquisition earlier this year , international sales were " broadly similar to the first half " .
An hour after reporting a collapse in European earnings on Wednesday , Te ##sco shares had lost nearly 5 per cent .
Second , with Te ##sco valued at 20 per cent below the long ##- ##ter ##m average at only 13 times 2014 earnings , investors were already pricing in further disappointment ##s .

Mr Higgins ##on raised a cool Pound ##s 1 ##m through the sale of 231 ##, ##8 ##8 ##7 shares in Te ##sco at 46 ##4 ##p , after the shares had bounced 7 per cent on Sir Terry ' ##s comments that were surprisingly bull ##ish despite d ##rea ##ry summer sales reported with the retailer ' ##s first ##- ##hal ##f results this week .
Te ##sco starts sales fight ##back with new v ##ou ##cher campaign
Last week Te ##sco reported its worst domestic sales performance for decades and issued its first profit warning in 20 years , after its " Big Price Drop " failed to revive sales over the Christmas and new year trading period .
unused ##1 The move comes after Philip Clarke , chief executive , blamed a f ##ero ##cious fight ##back from rival supermarket ##s for the 2 ##. ##3 per cent decline in Te ##sco ' ##s UK sales from stores open at least a year , as its big competitors bomb ##arded customers with v ##ou ##chers and coup ##ons .
unused ##1 " There was a lot of promotional coup ##oning going on around Christmas , " Mr Clarke said when the profit warning was announced last Thursday .
unused ##1 Last month the retailer showed it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as it reported the first slow ##down in underlying sales growth for two years .
unused ##1 Overall sales in the UK rose 11 ##. ##6 per cent in the third quarter .
unused ##1 Growth in non ##- ##food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double ##- ##di ##git ##s .
However , the market , which has become used to Te ##sco significantly out ##per ##form ##ing its rivals , gave a l ##uke ##warm response to the figures , which showed under ##- ##lying sales up 5 ##. ##7 per cent in the seven weeks to January 7 with volumes up 7 ##. ##2 per cent .
unused ##1 With like ##- for ##- ##like volumes up 7 ##. ##2 per cent , to have held these gains and to have seen no switching back ( by customers ) to Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s , we are really pleased . "
J Sai ##ns ##bury showed a 5 ##. ##2 per cent rise in underlying sales in the third quarter .
unused ##1 " On identical space , Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like gain will have been better than Te ##sco ' ##s for the first time in a very long time , " Mr Fowler wrote .
Te ##sco ' ##s total sales over the period grew 11 ##. ##5 per cent against 12 ##. ##1 per cent last year .
unused ##1 The international business , which accounts for just over one ##- fifth of profits , had a slow ##down in sales , which rose 16 ##. ##1 per cent over the period .
unused ##1 They rose 23 ##. ##3 per cent in the previous quarter .
unused ##1 Full ##- ##ye ##ar profit forecast ##s are unchanged at Pound ##s 2 ##. ##1 ##b ##n ##- ##P ##ou ##nds 2 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.
Te ##sco said yesterday it was feeling the effects of the consumer slow ##down in its home market as Britain ' ##s biggest retail chain failed to match up to sales expectations .
Te ##sco said conditions had been more difficult over Christmas , but it enjoyed a 3 ##. ##1 per cent lift in underlying sales - against expectations of 4 ##- ##4 ##. ##5 per cent - in the six weeks to January 5 .
unused ##1 He said central Europe had delivered a 30 per cent sales up ##lift .
unused ##1 Overall the international business , which now accounts for nearly a quarter of group sales and a fifth of profits , enjoyed sales growth of 26 ##. ##9 per cent .
The I ##G ##D , the food research body , said yesterday that it expected Te ##sco ' ##s international turnover to increase by Pound ##s 30 ##b ##n ( Dollar ##s 59 ##b ##n ) to Pound ##s 74 ##b ##n by 2012 .
At a press brief ##ing to un ##ve ##il Te ##sco ' ##s joint venture in China , Frank Lai , finance director of China Resources Enterprise , was keen to praise his new partner .
unused ##1 After a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n investment in the UK to counter ##act di ##sma ##l domestic trading , and deals to exit the US and partially China , the retailer is now fighting another fire in central Europe , where profits have collapsed .
After its first profit warning in 20 years in January 2012 , Te ##sco set out plans to overhaul the UK , and chief executive Philip Clarke said this was beginning to work .
unused ##1 Sales from UK stores open at least a year were flat on the year ##- ##ear ##lier period in the three months to the end of August , compared with a 1 per cent decline in the preceding quarter .
unused ##1 Indeed , trading profit in central Europe slumped 70 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##55 ##m , compared with analysts ' forecast ##s of about pound ##( ##s ##) ##13 ##0 ##m .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke revealed that sales of Te ##sco ' ##s tablet , the Hu ##dl , which went on sale on Monday , were better than forecast , helped by a higher staff discount this week .
unused ##1 Prof ##it warning
Te ##sco shares plunged yesterday after the UK retailer issued a profit warning in the wake of disappointing Christmas trading in its UK heart ##land .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke said its growth ambitions in non ##- ##food items could be increasingly satisfied through internet sales rather than building more " big box " stores .
unused ##1 Sales in the six weeks to January 7 were down 2 ##. ##3 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the UK on a like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and value added tax .
unused ##1 This was weaker than the 0 ##. ##9 per cent decline posted in the third quarter of its financial year , which ended in November .
Te ##sco said it now expected to deliver " minimal " growth in trading profit and underlying pre ##- ##ta ##x profit in its next financial year , compared with the 10 per cent growth anticipated by the market .
unused ##1 Laurie M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e , finance director , said recently that there were signs of improvement at Fresh & Easy after the business was re ##lau ##nched , with sales rising 37 ##. ##4 per cent in the third quarter , and also stronger like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales .
Consequently , Te ##sco ex ##- ##pect ##s the business to make a loss over the full year close to its $ ##25 ##9 ##m ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##0 ##m ) deficit of last year .
Te ##sco has also put an expansion into northern California on hold but has continued to acquire sites in central to northern California .
Ms Neville ##- ##R ##ol ##fe also points out that Te ##sco , which operates in 14 countries , has international opportunities elsewhere .
She points to China , which will be a big focus for Te ##sco this year , and India .
" Now those wheels are back on and , if anything , Te ##sco is a little bit of a lean ##er , mean ##er machine , capable of going faster in terms of paying down debt and focusing on the business . "
Another issue facing Te ##sco is whether it can re ##cap ##ture its p ##oise in the UK grocery market , which accounts for more than two ##- ##thi ##rds of its profits and sales .
unused ##1 For much of 2009 it la ##gged behind its main rivals in terms of UK sales growth based on stores open at least a year .
In spite of the Club ##card assault , Te ##sco ' ##s UK like ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the three months to the end of November rose by 2 ##. ##8 per cent , less than expectations .

" If Te ##sco counts these as cash sales in its Christmas trading statement and treats them as it did in its third ##- ##qua ##rter trading statement , it will artificial ##ly in ##f ##late reported sales by 1 to 2 per cent . "
Te ##sco has rejected any suggestion of additional Club ##card v ##ou ##chers artificial ##ly in ##f ##lating sales , and Ms Neville ##- ##R ##ol ##fe says that if they make an unexpected difference to sales , Te ##sco will make this clear .

Te ##sco under pressure from talk of a cut in earnings guidance
Te ##sco hit a four ##- ##mont ##h low yesterday as analysts raised fears that the g ##ro ##cer would cut earnings guidance .
unused ##1 In ##ves ##tec Securities argued that management needed to re ##in in guidance so that it can keep UK profit margins stable .
With sales falling and customers moving online , Te ##sco ' ##s only option to defend margins is by raising prices , In ##ves ##tec said .
Ana ##ly ##sts expect Te ##sco ' ##s trading update due tomorrow to show that sales growth has stalled since Christmas , with same ##- ##sto ##re sales expected to be down by about 0 ##. ##5 per cent .

Te ##sco yesterday called on the Bank of England to cut interest rates in spite of Britain ' ##s biggest retailer appearing imp ##er ##vious to any difficulties facing the high street as it announced an improvement in sales .
unused ##1 However , some hint of a slow ##down was evident as Mr Higgins ##on said non ##- ##food sales were falling back a little as shop ##pers held back from buying more in ##du ##lge ##nt purchases beyond their weekly food shop .
unused ##1 Sign ##s of a down ##turn have yet to show in the headline figures , with underlying UK sales excluding petrol up 4 ##. ##1 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 24 - ahead of J Sai ##ns ##bury and W ##m Morrison ' ##s latest figures - and group sales up 11 ##. ##8 per cent .

Almost a year after Te ##sco revealed a surprising Pound ##s 155 ##. ##6 ##m acquisition attempt , the supermarket group appeared to have its green fingers on the keys of Do ##bb ##ies , having fought Sir Tom , the retail and property entrepreneur , on the stock market and via the courts .
Sir Tom - who controls W ##yev ##ale , the UK ' ##s biggest garden centre chain - had accused Do ##bb ##ies ' board of " rolling over " for Te ##sco ' ##s initial bid last year and subsequently attempted to f ##rust ##rate the acquisition , resort ##ing to court last week in an unsuccessful bid to block an equity issue that could have di ##lut ##ed his holding .
After a difficult campaign , Te ##sco should now succeed in con ##sol ##ida ##ting its first non ##- ##food acquisition , which will continue to be run and developed separately under the Do ##bb ##ies brand name .
Te ##sco rallied to its best level since last year ' ##s profit warning yesterday as analysts backed the group to regain investors ' trust .
unused ##1 With h ##yper ##market ##s making up 92 per cent of Te ##sco ' ##s Korean floors ##pace , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the country may have dropped 8 per cent this year , it said .
The jump came after Bloomberg reported that V ##oda ##fo ##ne had been in merger talks with V ##eri ##zon Communications as recently as December , which had stalled over disagreements on leadership and corporate base .
Car ins ##urer Admiral bounced 5 ##. ##3 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##34 after its annual earnings and divide ##nd topped expectations .

unused ##1 Rest ##ric ##tions introduced eight years ago are designed to limit sales to a maximum of 100 tablets in a single transaction without a prescription .
unused ##1 Additional voluntary measures with retailers limit sales to two packs at a time .
Seven years after V ##oda ##fo ##ne last received a divide ##nd from V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the leading US mobile phone operator , the UK te ##le ##com ##s group will get a new pay ##- ##out in 2012 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne , which has a 45 per cent stake in V ##eri ##zon Wireless , its joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications , will get a $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ) pay ##- ##out from the US mobile operator in January .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne will respond by paying a pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##b ##n special divide ##nd to its shareholders in February .
And why did V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nd payments stop in 2005 ?
V ##eri ##zon Communications , the US te ##le ##com ##s group which owns 55 per cent of V ##eri ##zon Wireless , has been hint ##ing since the middle of last year that the mobile operator would once again pay divide ##nds .
She estimated V ##eri ##zon Communications ' fixed ##- ##line phone business generated little or no cash , and therefore she argued it had become a necessity for the US group to obtain divide ##nds from V ##eri ##zon Wireless .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne never wanted V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds to stop in 2005 , but , as the minority shareholder , it had no say over the matter .
V ##eri ##zon Communications decided six years ago that the cash generated by V ##eri ##zon Wireless should be used to pay down its debt .
However , many analysts saw the halt to the mobile operator ' ##s divide ##nd payments as an attempt to squeeze V ##oda ##fo ##ne out of V ##eri ##zon Wireless .
Mr M ##c ##A ##dam and Mr Cola ##o are members of the V ##eri ##zon Wireless board , which at a meeting on Thursday agreed the $ ##10 ##b ##n divide ##nd payment .
Ana ##ly ##sts highlighted how the V ##eri ##zon Wireless board had only approved a one ##- ##off divide ##nd for 2012 , but V ##oda ##fo ##ne hopes the US mobile operator ' ##s cash distributions will become a recurring , annual event , because of V ##eri ##zon Communications ' need to maintain its own pay ##- ##out to shareholders .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne is returning 70 per cent of its $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n to shareholders via its special divide ##nd , and the remainder will be used to reduce the UK group ' ##s net debt .
If V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds do continue beyond 2012 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne could use some of the cash for acquisitions .
unused ##1 It is interested in buying rivals in some of its existing markets , including those in Europe and India .
Mr M ##c ##A ##dam and Mr Cola ##o have both recently played down the idea of a merger between V ##eri ##zon Communications and V ##oda ##fo ##ne .
unused ##1 But one investor who knows the two groups said a merger was possible in the medium to long term .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts at Morgan Stanley down ##graded their recommendation on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s shares from " buy " to " sell " after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European mobile businesses by Pound ##s 900 ##m between 2009 and 2012 .
unused ##1 He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would cut V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation by 11 per cent , or Pound ##s 900 ##m .

Con ##cer ##n Kali ##na , Russia ' ##s biggest local personal care company by sales , is expected to generate sales of EU ##R ##30 ##3 ##m this year .
The 9 per cent earnings growth reported by Pro ##cter & G ##amble on Monday has set the context for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s second ##- ##qua ##rter results tomorrow .
unused ##1 Even so , although the range of analysts ' forecast ##s is wide , some are expecting no more than 1 ##. ##5 per cent underlying sales growth , which would represent a slow ##down in momentum compared with the first quarter .

In China , one of the few emerging markets where P ##& ##G boasts a longer history than Un ##ile ##ver , L ##' ##O ##real lifted sales by 11 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in its first quarter .
unused ##1 Sad ##ly , yesterday ' ##s 2 per cent increase in turnover and 0 ##. ##2 per cent decline in operating margin was not satisfactory .
One quarter is too soon to declare this recovery stalled , but the continued slide in European sales ( still more than a third of Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s business ) is an alarm ##ing sign of how much more he has to do .
unused ##1 But on Monday it agreed to spend $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n on Alberto C ##ul ##ver , which mostly sells its s ##ham ##po ##o and cream ##s in the US and the UK - s ##lug ##gis ##h markets at best .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s personal care sector is also growing fast : sales rose 16 per cent in the first half of this year , about twice as fast as ice cream and home care .
unused ##1 Ad ##d those to Alberto C ##ul ##ver ' ##s expected $ ##26 ##0 ##m operating profit next year , take off tax , and earnings should rise by about $ ##29 ##0 ##m .
unused ##1 In other words , the acquisition will deliver an initial return of about 8 per cent , more or less in line with estimates for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s post ##- ##ac ##quisition weighted average cost of capital .
Yesterday Un ##ile ##ver , which already owns just over half of H ##U ##L , offered Rs ##60 ##0 to buy up to another 23 per cent of it .
So a EU ##R ##19 ##m gain versus Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s forecast earnings of EU ##R ##5 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 Other good news included a 5 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar increase in fourth ##- ##qua ##rter like ##- for ##- ##like group sales .

St ##rik ##ingly , however , Un ##ile ##ver increased its operating margin by 60 basis points ( P ##& ##G ' ##s was up by 80 ##b ##ps ) , while delivering a he ##fty increase in advertising and promotional spending - worth 220 ##b ##p of sales .
Meanwhile , the she ##en dim ##med a little this week on domestic rival Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser , whose first ##- ##qua ##rter figures failed , un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally , to meet expectations .

unused ##1 Under ##lying first ##- ##hal ##f sales growth of 3 ##. ##4 per cent is hardly stellar .
P ##eers such as Pro ##cter & G ##amble , which on Wednesday said underlying second ##- ##qua ##rter sales rose 8 per cent , managed underlying sales growth of more than 6 per cent last year .
unused ##1 Under ##lying operating margins , 14 per cent in the second quarter , were 1 percentage point lower than a year ago .
Fast ##- ##mo ##ving consumer goods companies must change their business models and develop brands that sell more cheap ##ly , Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s chief executive said as the group reported second ##- ##qua ##rter underlying sales up 4 ##. ##1 per cent .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s shares yesterday rose 84 ##p to pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##. ##29 as it reported a 2 per cent rise in second ##- ##qua ##rter sales volumes following a 1 ##. ##8 per cent fall in the first quarter .
The volume increase reflects a focus on innovation under Mr Pol ##man ' ##s leadership , who has replaced 35 of Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s top 100 executives since taking on the chief executive job at the start of the year .
unused ##1 Sales volumes in Europe rose 1 per cent following five quarters of decline ##s as the company increased spending on advertising and promotions for the first time in a year .
unused ##1 For the first half , total sales were steady at EU ##R ##19 ##. ##9 ##6 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##17 ##b ##n ) , while pre ##- ##ta ##x profits fell from EU ##R ##3 ##. ##14 ##b ##n to EU ##R ##2 ##. ##29 ##b ##n due to one ##- ##time disposal profits a year earlier , as well as pension financing and tax charges .
unused ##1 E ##ar ##ning ##s per share before restructuring costs fell from 79 ##cent ##s to 53 cents .
With analysts forecast ##ing pre ##- ##ta ##x profit of EU ##R ##5 ##. ##7 ##b ##n for 2009 , Un ##ile ##ver now is trading in line with its peers on a price / earnings ratio of 14 ##. ##4 and is fairly valued .
Un ##ile ##ver has raised hopes of a sustained turn ##rou ##nd in its business after the consumer goods company yesterday reported good financial results for the second consecutive quarter , with underlying sales rising 3 ##. ##3 per cent due to growth in emerging markets .
unused ##1 The results surprised analysts , who had questioned whether the company - which has struggled to match the performance of competitors such as Pro ##cter & G ##amble in recent years - could match its strong first ##- ##qua ##rter earnings .
Ana ##ly ##sts said Un ##ile ##ver produced its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2002 in spite of a second write ##- down in its meal replacement business , Slim ##- ##F ##ast .
Un ##ile ##ver took a Euro ##s 35 ##3 ##m ( Pound ##s 244 ##m ) write ##- ##down in Slim ##- ##F ##ast after sales of its products fell 25 per cent in the first half .
The Slim ##- ##F ##ast write ##- ##down hurt Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s operating profits , which fell 18 per cent in the quarter .
The rise in overall sales volume was driven by strong demand for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s products , including O ##mo laundry de ##ter ##gent and Pond ' ##s cream , in Asia and Africa .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s performance in Europe remains weak due to pricing pressure from hard discount ##ers and competition among manufacturers , and underlying European sales fell 0 ##. ##6 per cent in the second quarter .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s first ##- ##qua ##rter sales volumes were poor , dropping 1 ##. ##8 per cent , compared with a 1 ##. ##6 per cent fall in the previous quarter .
Under ##lying sales growth of 4 ##. ##8 per cent was stronger than expected as Un ##ile ##ver benefited from price increases pushed through last year .
Western Europe remains a difficult market for Un ##ile ##ver , with sales volumes dropping 3 ##. ##7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own ##- ##la ##bel products .
Paul Pol ##man , Un ##ile ##ver chief executive , warned of a " pro ##tracted " global economic recovery and price def ##lation as the maker of Li ##pton tea and Suns ##il ##k s ##ham ##po ##o reported strong third ##- ##qua ##rter results .
Yesterday , Mr Pol ##man proved that his changes - which include turning round under ##per ##form ##ing brands and stepping up the pace of innovation - were making a difference at Un ##ile ##ver as the company beat analysts ' expectations with underlying sales growth of 3 ##. ##4 per cent and volume growth of 3 ##. ##6 per cent .
James Edward ##es Jones , analyst at Ex ##ec ##ution , said : " Excellent third ##- ##qua ##rter results indicate Un ##ile ##ver is doing what it said it would do . "
Ana ##ly ##sts were heart ##ened to see volume and sales growth , which was delivered in all regions , was not achieved by cut ##backs in marketing spending , with Un ##ile ##ver increasing spending on advertising and promotions by 130 ##b ##p .
Un ##ile ##ver investors yesterday raised concerns about the company ' ##s ability to generate healthy profits , as the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch consumer goods manufacturer reported a sharp decline in second ##- ##qua ##rter operating margins .
unused ##1 The shares slid 75 pen ##ce , or 5 ##. ##8 per cent , to Pound ##s 12 ##. ##14 after the maker of Dove soap and Suns ##il ##k s ##ham ##po ##o surprised analysts with a 1 point drop in underlying margins to 14 ##. ##6 per cent .
unused ##1 Julian Hard ##wick , analyst at AB ##N Am ##ro , said : " The margin performance was very disappointing . "
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s sales are growing faster in Asia and Africa than in the Americas or Europe .

Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s shares rose nearly 5 per cent yesterday after the company showed it was on the path to sustained growth by delivering its third consecutive quarter of profit margin improvement .
Un ##ile ##ver , the maker of K ##nor ##r soup ##s and Dove s ##ham ##po ##o , said underlying sales grew 4 ##. ##5 per cent in the third quarter , and operating margins rose 0 ##. ##2 percentage points to 13 ##. ##7 per cent after restructuring costs .
unused ##1 The company attributed the healthy sales growth to a strong performance in em ##er ##g ##- ing markets , which account for 44 per cent of total sales .
unused ##1 It stressed that all product categories , with the exception of ice cream , were showing sales and profit growth .
Total sales of ice cream fell Euro ##s 70 ##m ( Dollar ##s 101 ##. ##3 ##m ) in the third quarter compared with a year earlier , with Un ##ile ##ver b ##laming the decline on a cool European summer .
Ana ##ly ##sts were impressed that Un ##ile ##ver had managed to increase profit margins in the face of higher commodity costs , including mineral oil , which Un ##ile ##ver uses in its home and personal care products .
After the sweeping unification of Royal Dutch ##/ Shell and the earlier successful merger of Reed El ##se ##vier ' ##s management structures , Un ##ile ##ver has only half ##- ##gra ##sp ##ed its chance .
Its renewed commitment to the brands came as it sold its North American laundry brands for $ ##1 ##. ##45 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##7 ##30 ##m ) to private equity group V ##esta ##r Capital Partners .
unused ##1 Growth of the brands has , however , la ##gged behind those in emerging markets , where sales have risen 6 to 8 per cent during the past three years .
Inc ##reased marketing investment in ice ##- ##cre ##am , s ##ham ##po ##os and de ##od ##oran ##ts led to higher third ##- ##qua ##rter sales at Un ##ile ##ver , whose underlying revenue growth of 4 ##. ##8 per cent surpassed expectations .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts were happy to see an improvement on last quarter ' ##s sales growth of 3 ##. ##9 per cent .
Un ##ile ##ver surprised investors by announcing a one ##- ##off Euro ##s 750 ##m ( Pound ##s 50 ##2 ##m ) divide ##nd , which replaces a planned Euro ##s 500 ##m share buy ##- ##back , to be paid in December .
unused ##1 This quarter it reported margins of 14 ##. ##8 per cent , 80 basis points lower than the same period a year earlier .

Un ##ile ##ver , the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch consumer goods group , plans to spend up to $ ##5 ##. ##4 ##b ##n to buy a further slice of Hindus ##tan Un ##ile ##ver , marking the latest s ##wo ##op by a multinational on an Indian ##- ##listed subsidiary and the largest ever acquisition in the country ' ##s consumer goods sector .
That is roughly in line with similar deals carried out by multinational ##s , most recently drug ##maker G ##lax ##o ##S ##mith ##- ##K ##line which late last year lifted its 43 ##. ##2 per cent stake in its pivotal Indian division , G ##lax ##o ##S ##mith ##K ##line Consumer Healthcare , to 75 per cent .

Un ##ile ##ver in EU ##R ##1 ##. ##3 ##b ##n deal for Sara Lee brands
Ra ##dox bubble ##bat ##h and B ##ryl ##cre ##em hair gel will join Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s brand portfolio after the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch multinational agreed to pay EU ##R ##1 ##. ##27 ##b ##n ( $ ##1 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ) in cash for Sara Lee ' ##s personal care business to strengthen its competitive position in Europe .
The acquisition , the first one made with the direct involvement of new chief executive Paul Pol ##man , gives Un ##ile ##ver San ##ex hand ##wash ##es , shower gel ##s and de ##od ##oran ##ts as well as the Dutch personal care brand Z ##wi ##ts ##al and German brand Du ##sch ##das .
The Sara Lee business is worth EU ##R ##75 ##0 ##m in sales , and has earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation of EU ##R ##12 ##8 ##m , making the value of the deal a reasonable 10 times e ##bit ##da .

With sales of the local brands in decline , and Un ##ile ##ver holding the number three position in the ma ##rga ##rine market , the company decided the best option for the local brands was to sell them .
Un ##ile ##ver is today expected to announce a four ##- ##ye ##ar agreement to buy Pound ##s 200 ##m worth of air ##time with ITV , b ##ucking the trend of declining advertising revenues at the broadcaster .
S ##hare ##holders in ITV have been concerned about an expected 14 per cent fall in advertising on ITV ##1 , its core mass ##- ##market channel , in the first quarter of the year ##and are expecting guidance about whether ITV sees this as a seasonal an ##oma ##ly or a pattern for the full year .

Un ##ile ##ver looks to clean up in Alberto C ##ul ##ver buy
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s s ##wo ##op on Alberto C ##ul ##ver was predominantly greeted with enthusiasm by analysts and investors , with most seeing it as a s ##hr ##ew ##d move into the fastest ##- ##gro ##wing sector of the consumer goods industry .
As ##suming earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation for 2010 of $ ##25 ##9 ##m ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##3 ##m ) and the small amount of cash held by Alberto C ##ul ##ver , the $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n price tag will mean an enterprise value to e ##bit ##da multiple of 14 times .
unused ##1 It compares favour ##ably with the most recent acquisition in personal care products , that of Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser taking over SS ##L International , the maker of Du ##re ##x condom ##s and Sc ##hol ##l foot ##care , in July this year for pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 The group ' ##s operating margins in the personal care category , which includes hair ##care , were 15 ##. ##5 per cent last year , above the group margin of 12 ##. ##6 per cent .
In the most recent quarter , Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s sales of health personal care goods rose 7 ##. ##8 per cent to EU ##R ##3 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n ) , compared with growth of only 3 ##. ##5 per cent for ice ##- ##cre ##am and beverages , and 0 ##. ##5 per cent for sa ##vour ##y foods , dressing ##s and spreads .
A similar dynamic is at work at Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s rival Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser , the maker of C ##ill ##it Bang cleaner and Fin ##ish dish ##wash ##er powder , where health and personal care is growing at 14 per cent a year , compared with 8 per cent growth across the whole business .
The personal care business of Sara Lee , acquired last year , was equally weighted toward developed markets , with most of its sales in western Europe , comprising brands such as Ra ##dox and B ##ryl ##cre ##em .
unused ##1 In the most recent quarter , underlying sales at Un ##ile ##ver in western Europe fell 2 per cent to EU ##R ##1 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 However , in Asia , Africa and central and eastern Europe , sales rose 8 per cent , to pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Household goods ; S ##hare ##s up 10 % after chief ' ##s statement ; Sales poor but plans to improve volume
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s first ##- ##qua ##rter sales levels were poor , dropping 1 ##. ##8 per cent , compared to a 1 ##. ##6 per cent decline in the previous quarter .
Under ##lying sales growth of 4 ##. ##8 per cent was stronger than expected as Un ##ile ##ver benefited from price increases pushed through last year .
Western Europe remains a difficult market for Un ##ile ##ver , with sales volumes dropping 3 ##. ##7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own ##- ##la ##bel products , particularly in ma ##rga ##rine .
Un ##ile ##ver reports 5 ##. ##5 % sales rise
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s success in marketing anti ##- ##dan ##dr ##uff s ##ham ##po ##o to the Russians and Chinese and slim ##ming tea ##s to the French helped the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch conglomerate report strong full ##- ##ye ##ar sales growth of 5 ##. ##5 per cent yesterday , under ##lining its transformation into a more robust company .
unused ##1 Mar ##gins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13 ##. ##7 per cent .
unused ##1 Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposal ##s since 2000 have carved out Euro ##s 8 ##b ##n worth of revenues .
unused ##1 In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain s ##lug ##gis ##h .
So while Un ##ile ##ver expects to hit the top end of its 3 ##- ##5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still la ##gs behind peers .
Un ##ile ##ver sparks strong interest on talk of big divide ##nd
Un ##ile ##ver was in focus yesterday amid talk the consumer goods company could soon announce plans for a large capital return .
Un ##ile ##ver is due to an ##n ##- ##ou ##nce full ##- ##ye ##ar results on February 7 and analysts believe the company may commit to a large divide ##nd increase , a bigger share buy ##- ##back or both .
Prof ##it taking prompted by the Bo ##E rate decision left mortgage lend ##er Alliance & Leicester 4 per cent lower at 72 ##4 1 ##/ ##2 ##p .
unused ##1 Down 18 per cent on Wednesday after a di ##sma ##l trading statement , its shares fell a further 3 ##. ##5 per cent to 395 ##p as analysts cut forecast ##s and down ##graded .
unused ##1 Joint house broker Morgan Stanley lowered its rating to " equal ##- weight " from " over ##- ##weight " and said it was no longer convinced that M ##& ##S would prove more defensive than the rest of the retail sector in the current consumer down ##turn .
On a brighter note , J Sai ##ns ##bury rallied 6 ##. ##3 per cent to 38 ##8 ##p on the back of a reassuring third ##- ##qua ##rter trading update .
unused ##1 Evolution Securities down ##graded to " add " from " buy " .
unused ##1 Securities advised clients to sell down to 60 ##p .
Un ##ile ##ver suffers Europe sales fall
Un ##ile ##ver yesterday joined the list of consumer goods companies reporting results that disappointed investors , as the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch multinational ' ##s first ##- ##qua ##rter sales in Europe fell .
N ##est ##le and Di ##age ##o , respectively the world ' ##s biggest food group and di ##st ##ille ##r , have reported earnings in recent days that fell short of investors ' expectations .
Pro ##cter & G ##amble ' ##s shares fell heavily on Wednesday after the owner of brands such as Pan ##ten ##e and C ##rest reported disappointing sales figures .
Un ##ile ##ver , maker of Flora ma ##rga ##rine and Dove s ##ham ##po ##o , had to con ##tend with strong comparable ##s from the year ##- ##ago period and poor spring weather across Europe , which c ##rim ##ped ice cream sales .
unused ##1 The company reported a rise in annual underlying sales growth in the first quarter of 4 ##. ##9 per cent , 70 basis points below consensus market expectations .
On a reported basis , and taking into account a negative hit from foreign exchange rates , Un ##ile ##ver lifted turnover 0 ##. ##2 per cent to EU ##R ##12 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.
Europe overall proved the weak spot ; underlying sales reversed 3 ##. ##1 per cent as people both bought fewer Un ##ile ##ver goods and paid less for them .
unused ##1 Overall the French group reported organic sales growth of 6 ##. ##1 per cent versus consensus of 7 ##. ##4 per cent .
unused ##1 He said the European ##bus ##iness , which accounts ##fo ##r some 40 per cent of turnover , was making progress because its rate of decline in underlying sales has slowed from 3 per cent in 2004 to 0 ##. ##5 per cent in the first quarter .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s total underlying sales have been growing at around 3 per cent .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver to buy Alberto C ##ul ##ver in $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n deal
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver is to buy Alberto C ##ul ##ver , the US consumer products group , in a $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ) deal that will see it bring brands such as T ##RE ##S ##em ##me and V ##O ##5 s ##ham ##po ##os into the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch conglomerate ' ##s stable of hair care and skin care products .
unused ##1 It would be the second big takeover under his tenure , following on from the $ ##1 ##. ##9 ##b ##n deal to acquire the European personal care division of Sara Lee in September last year .
unused ##1 The proposed price tag values the company , including its small cash pile , at about 14 times the consensus forecast for its 2010 earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation of $ ##25 ##9 ##m .
For the 12 months ending in June , Alberto C ##ul ##ver made revenues of $ ##1 ##. ##6 ##b ##n and earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation of more than $ ##25 ##0 ##m .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s European laundry brands , which include Per ##si ##l , Sur ##f and Co ##m ##fort , are estimated to have just over EU ##R ##1 ##b ##n ( $ ##1 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ) in sales .
unused ##1 Growth of these brands has however la ##gged progress in emerging markets , where sales have risen between 6 per cent and 8 per cent over the past three years .

Un ##ile ##ver turnover rises 10 ##. ##5 % despite European weakness
Un ##ile ##ver , the consumer goods conglomerate , continued to steal a march over rivals , lifting turnover 10 ##. ##5 per cent year on year to EU ##R ##51 ##. ##3 ##b ##n last calendar year .
unused ##1 Operating profit rose 9 per cent to EU ##R ##7 ##b ##n for the full year and was up 7 per cent to EU ##R ##4 ##. ##9 ##b ##n on a net basis .
unused ##1 Food volumes s ##hra ##nk and sales of spreads fell .
unused ##1 Full ##y di ##lut ##ed earnings per share were up 5 per cent at EU ##R ##1 ##. ##5 ##4 ##.
Mr Pol ##man ' ##s comments echo rival Pro ##cter & G ##amble , which on Wednesday said it would step up efforts to make cheaper " value ##fo ##cus ##ed " products as its sales volumes dropped 4 per cent .
Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s shares yesterday rose 5 ##. ##4 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##. ##34 as it reported a 2 per cent rise in second ##- ##qua ##rter sales volumes following a 1 ##. ##8 per cent decline in the first quarter .
unused ##1 Under ##lying sales rose 4 ##. ##1 per cent in the quarter .
unused ##1 Sales volumes in Europe rose 1 per cent following five quarters of decline ##s as the company increased spending on advertising and promotions for the first time in a year .
unused ##1 Sales volumes rose 3 ##. ##3 per cent in developing countries , more than double the rate of growth in either the Americas or Europe .
unused ##1 Total sales rose 1 per cent to EU ##R ##10 ##. ##46 ##b ##n ( $ ##15 ##b ##n ) .
unused ##1 Second ##- ##qua ##rter pre ##- ##ta ##x profits fell 12 per cent to EU ##R ##1 ##. ##2 ##b ##n due to one ##- ##time disposal profits a year earlier , as well as pension financing and tax charges .
Under ##lying sales growth was strongest in Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s home care business during the quarter , with sales up 9 ##. ##2 per cent .
unused ##1 Personal care sales rose 5 ##. ##4 per cent ; ice cream and beverage sales were up 4 ##. ##9 per cent ; and sa ##vour ##y , dressing and spread sales fell 0 ##. ##2 per cent .
S ##hare ##s in Un ##ile ##ver rose 2 ##. ##7 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##18 ##. ##16 after industry data showed sales of product lines such as ice ##- ##cre ##am and de ##od ##oran ##t a ##cc ##ele ##rating since July .
unused ##1 " This improvement under ##pin ##s our view that volume growth will surprise on the upside , " said JP ##M ##or ##gan , which repeated an " over ##weight " rating .
It thought C ##ad ##bury ' ##s UK sales had been sharply below company targets since July .
The company has c ##rank ##ed up its promotions after last month ' ##s bid from K ##raft , so a sales miss looks unlikely , JP ##M ##or ##gan added .
W ##hit ##bre ##ad added 1 ##. ##6 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##12 ##. ##6 ##9 ahead of results on Tuesday , with Morgan Stanley , U ##BS and Deutsche Bank all advising clients to buy before the release .
unused ##1 An upgrade this week from Bar ##C ##ap also helped .
unused ##1 U ##BS said the move provided a significant sales boost , as fibre wholesale ta ##riff ##s are un ##re ##gu ##lated and allow service b ##und ##ling .
unused ##1 Piper J ##af ##far ##y , which cut Auto ##no ##my to " neutral , " worried that deals might have been pulled forward to help beat forecast ##s and argued that hopes of a bid from Microsoft looked unlikely both on strategy and price .
Among the mid ##- ##cap ##s , DS ##G International rose 1 per cent to 27 ##p after So ##c ##G ##en added the retailer to its " buy " list , encouraged by the fact that most of DS ##G ' ##s management was taking up a share scheme that swap ##ped basic salary for three ##- ##ye ##ar options priced at 28 ##. ##4 ##p a ##piece .
Strong growth in its wireless joint venture with V ##oda ##fo ##ne helped fourth ##- ##qua ##rter results at V ##eri ##zon Communications , but quarterly profits la ##gged behind those of a year ##ear ##lier , mainly reflecting charges related to asset sales .
V ##eri ##zon , the second ##- ##lar ##ges ##t US telecommunications group , said fourth ##- ##qua ##rter profit had fallen to Dollar ##s 1 ##b ##n , or 35 cents per share , from Dollar ##s 1 ##. ##7 ##b ##n , or 59 cents per share , a year ago .
V ##eri ##zon ' ##s fourth ##- ##qua ##rter revenue rose 26 per cent to Dollar ##s 22 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Net income before these and other special items was Dollar ##s 1 ##. ##8 ##1 ##b ##n , or 62 cents a share , compared with Dollar ##s 1 ##. ##7 ##8 ##b ##n , or 64 cents a share , including ##dis ##con ##tin ##ued operations .
The shift is intended to offset the continued decline in traditional ##res ##iden ##tial voice services . V ##eri ##zon Wireless , a joint venture between V ##eri ##zon and Britain ' ##s V ##oda ##fo ##ne Group , added 2 ##. ##3 ##m net customers in the fourth quarter , bringing its nationwide total to 59 ##. ##1 ##m and closing the gap with C ##ing ##ular Wireless which ended the year with 61 ##m subscribers .
unused ##1 Chu ##rn , a key measure of customer loyalty , fell to 1 ##. ##14 per cent in the fourth ##qua ##rter from 1 ##. ##24 per cent in the previous period .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s declaration of a $ ##7 ##b ##n divide ##nd to be paid next month to its owners - V ##eri ##zon Communications and the UK ' ##s V ##oda ##fo ##ne - was subject yesterday to as many intricate interpretations as Elvis ' ##s death .
unused ##1 It has paid out part of the V ##eri ##zon Wireless divide ##nd stream previously , but with a stock buy ##back already under way that looks less certain this time .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne shares added 3 ##. ##4 per cent last week on news that it was in discussions about the future of its V ##eri ##zon Wireless venture , which does not at present pay a divide ##nd .
Tu ##llow Oil rose 2 ##. ##4 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##13 ##. ##13 following a report that Korea National Oil Company was interested in buying a stake in its Jubilee field in Ghana .
Denny St ##rig ##l , V ##eri ##zon ' ##s chief operating officer , said V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s net debt stood at about Dollar ##s 10 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s last divide ##nd payments from V ##eri ##zon Wireless were worth Dollar ##s 92 ##3 ##m .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s net debt stood at Dollar ##s 11 ##. ##3 ##b ##n in September 2006 , which is the most recent ##fi ##ling for the joint venture sent to US regulator ##s .
V ##eri ##zon Communications has dashed the hopes of V ##oda ##fo ##ne investors by ruling out a return to a recurring divide ##nd from the two companies ' US mobile phone joint venture , called V ##eri ##zon Wireless .
V ##eri ##zon Communications , V ##er ##- ##iz ##on Wireless ' ##s controlling shareholder with a 55 per cent stake , in July authorised a long ##- ##awa ##ited $ ##10 ##b ##n divide ##nd payment by the mobile operator to its par ##- ##ents .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless issued annual divide ##nds to its parents from the mobile operator ' ##s creation in 2000 until 2005 .
V ##eri ##zon Communications decided to halt the divide ##nds after 2005 because it wanted V ##eri ##zon Wireless to use the cash generated by the business to reduce the mobile operator ' ##s debt .
V ##eri ##zon Communications , V ##er ##- ##iz ##on Wireless ' ##s controlling shareholder with a 55 per cent stake , in July authorised a long ##- ##awa ##ited $ ##10 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ) divide ##nd by the mobile operator to its par ##- ##ents .
V ##eri ##zon Communications decided to halt the divide ##nds after 2005 because it wanted V ##eri ##zon Wireless to use the cash generated by the business to reduce the mobile operator ' ##s debt , but many analysts saw the controlling shareholder ' ##s move as an attempt to squeeze V ##oda ##fo ##ne out of the joint venture .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s shares closed up 6 ##. ##2 per cent at 115 ##p after the world ' ##s largest mobile phone operator by revenue confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##b ##n to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##5 ##b ##n for 2008 ##- ##0 ##9 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements .

unused ##1 Ad ##- ##ju ##sted operating profit rose 10 ##. ##5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , fuel ##led by s ##ter ##ling ' ##s weakness against the euro and the dollar .
unused ##1 On an underlying basis , operating profit fell 1 per cent .
Pre ##- ##ta ##x profit fell 27 ##. ##3 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##3 ##b ##n , partly because of a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##7 ##b ##n imp ##air ##ment charge on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s troubled Turkish business .
unused ##1 The interim divide ##nd rose 3 ##. ##2 per cent to 2 ##. ##5 ##7 ##p ##.
V ##oda ##fo ##ne is expected to say next week that its core profit margin will continue to fall in the current financial year , as the world ' ##s largest mobile phone group by revenue fights fierce competition in its European markets .
Leading industry analysts said V ##oda ##fo ##ne was likely to indicate at its 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 results presentation on Tuesday that the group ' ##s margin would de ##ter ##ior ##ate further in the year to March 31 2008 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne warned in May last year that its margin on organic adjusted earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation should decline by one percentage point in 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 , continuing a trend that began in 2005 ##- ##0 ##6 .
The de ##ter ##ior ##ating margin position highlighted at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s half ##- year results in November 2005 put pressure on A ##run Sa ##rin , the group ' ##s chief executive , although his relations with investors have since recovered .
unused ##1 In a research note , he estimated revenue of Pound ##s 31 ##. ##2 ##b ##n for 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 , up 6 ##. ##5 per cent , and e ##bit ##da of Pound ##s 12 ##b ##n , up 1 ##. ##8 per cent , delivering a margin of 38 ##. ##3 per cent .
But Mr Del ##fa ##s , who has a " buy " rating on V ##oda ##fo ##ne , calculated the margin would fall to 37 ##. ##5 per cent in 2007 ##- ##0 ##8 .
Mr Sinclair , who has a " hold " rating on V ##oda ##fo ##ne , estimated the margin would be 36 ##. ##4 per cent in 2007 ##- ##0 ##8 , partly because of spending on new customers .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne is seeking to expand into emerging markets , and last month bought Hu ##tch ##ison E ##ssa ##r , India ' ##s fourth largest mobile operator .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s shares closed up 6 ##. ##2 per cent at 115 ##p after the world ' ##s largest mobile phone operator confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##b ##n ( $ ##16 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ) to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##5 ##b ##n for 2008 ##- ##0 ##9 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements .

unused ##1 The weak oil price and a down ##grade from RB ##S did the damage .

Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n divide ##nd from US operator V ##eri ##zon Wireless , in which V ##oda ##fo ##ne owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s management will use the cash to fund a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n share buy ##- ##back programme .
unused ##1 Cash profits at ##tri ##but ##able to V ##oda ##fo ##ne from V ##eri ##zon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##. ##4 ##9 ##b ##n - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2 ##. ##2 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.

On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after V ##eri ##zon Wireless , its US joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications , ruled out regular divide ##nds .
unused ##1 This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $ ##10 ##b ##n divide ##nd - its first since 2005 .
It is not a secret that V ##eri ##zon stopped paying divide ##nds in an effort to force V ##oda ##fo ##ne to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to V ##eri ##zon .
But since then V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s trapped cash has been put to good use repay ##ing its debt and V ##oda ##fo ##ne and V ##eri ##zon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) .
unused ##1 On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1 ##. ##4 per cent year on year in the second quarter .
But V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s revenue growth also slowed from first ##- ##qua ##rter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3 ##. ##2 per cent decline in the UK .
unused ##1 Re ##sul ##t : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009 ##- ##10 .
unused ##1 First ##- ##hal ##f earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation , at pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##6 ##b ##n , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the e ##bit ##da margin slipped to 30 ##. ##5 per cent , compared with 31 ##. ##2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) .
Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent ##- ##own ##ed V ##eri ##zon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $ ##8 ##. ##5 ##b ##n divide ##nd to its two parents .
The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade ##- ##off for an earlier pay ##out , and V ##oda ##fo ##ne will return pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n to investors via a share buy ##back .
unused ##1 The non ##- ##E ##uro ##pe ##an interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1 ##. ##8 times e ##bit ##da .
unused ##1 The growth rate of V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s Indian revenue , which accounts for less than a 10th of its total sales , slowed to 13 per cent last year and was less than half that in the final quarter .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s full ##- ##ye ##ar earnings yesterday were like that .
unused ##1 Under ##lying revenues from phone services were down more than 4 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the final three months to March , the weak ##est quarterly result to date .
So , with V ##oda ##fo ##ne looking to take pound ##( ##s ##) ##30 ##0 ##m out of European operating expenses this year and seeing good growth in data usage , executives are projecting a 2013 ##/ ##14 operating profit of pound ##( ##s ##) ##12 ##b ##n ##- ##po ##und ##( ##s ##) ##12 ##. ##8 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 But divide ##nds are pledged to stay at current levels , giving a 5 ##. ##5 per cent yield .
unused ##1 In its first ##- ##qua ##rter results on Friday , the UK ##- ##base ##d mobile operator confirmed the complete di ##cho ##tom ##y it faces in its markets .
unused ##1 Revenue ##s in Turkey increased 32 per cent and India were up by 17 per cent ( although intense competition there limits profit ##ability ) .
unused ##1 On the flip side , the mature European business - which contributes about 70 per cent of revenues - barely grew as it nurse ##d revenue falls of 10 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in Greece .
unused ##1 A pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##b ##n share buy ##- ##back programme now under way will increase that figure to 1 ##. ##8 times - which would remain about 10 per cent below the company ' ##s target .
V ##eri ##zon has long looked to its successful US V ##eri ##zon Wireless business to prop up its declining fixed ##- ##line earnings .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s chief executive V ##itt ##orio Cola ##o had much pressure on him to return cash to investors , but his decision to return pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##b ##n of the divide ##nd to shareholders is not a cave ##- ##in .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne acquisition of C ##& ##W ##W opposed by Or ##bis
V ##oda ##fo ##ne agreed a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n takeover offer for Cable ##& Wireless Worldwide , although it could face opposition after C ##& ##W ##W ' ##s largest shareholder refused to back the deal .

The price offered by V ##oda ##fo ##ne is almost twice that of the C ##& ##W ##W share price before its expression of interest , although this had dropped about three ##- ##qua ##rter ##s since dem ##er ##ger from Cable & Wireless Communications , a UK ##- ##listed overseas te ##le ##com ##s business .

unused ##1 E ##ssa ##r , which has an option until May to sell its 33 per cent stake in the venture to V ##oda ##fo ##ne for $ ##5 ##b ##n , or sell a smaller stake at market value , said that the UK group had no power to change its plans to merge E ##ssa ##r ' ##s te ##le ##com ##s business with IS ##L .

Although V ##oda ##fo ##ne said it would use the Pound ##s 1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n to reduce its net debt of Pound ##s 20 ##. ##2 ##b ##n , some analysts predicted the sale proceeds could help finance expansion in emerging markets such as Africa , Asia and eastern Europe .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne has been t ##idy ##ing up its portfolio of businesses in western Europe , where fierce competition and pressure from regulator ##s for price cuts has resulted in slowing revenue growth and declining profit margins .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne raised its outlook for full ##- ##ye ##ar operating profit on the back of a stronger performance than expected in most of its big markets , which out ##wei ##gh ##ed a pound ##( ##s ##) ##45 ##0 ##m charge in its em ##bat ##tled Greek operations .

But shareholders were alarmed by how V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of group sales , for the first time reported falling underlying revenue in 2008 ##- ##20 ##0 ##9 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne had been hoping for a re ##sumption of divide ##nds in 2009 after V ##eri ##zon Wireless paid down its debt , but the timetable was pushed back to 2012 by the acquisition of All ##tel , a smaller US mobile operator .
On ##- ##off talks between V ##eri ##zon Communications and V ##oda ##fo ##ne about the future of V ##eri ##zon Wireless may finally be entering an end game , however , because the mobile operator is expected to be debt ##- ##free by the end of next year .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne has been urging its shareholders to be patient , even though some have long been unhappy about the lack of V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds .
V ##eri ##zon Communications paid a divide ##nd worth $ ##5 ##. ##3 ##b ##n in 2009 and Bernstein analysts said that problems at the US group ' ##s fixed ##- ##line phone business meant that it will need to tap V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' cash so as to maintain its shareholder re ##mu ##ner ##ation .

S ##hare ##s in Cable & Wireless Worldwide jumped almost 45 per cent after V ##oda ##fo ##ne confirmed that it was interested in bidding for the troubled te ##le ##com ##s group .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s interest surprised the market given the troubled financial position of C ##& ##W Worldwide , which had been struck by three profit warnings in 12 months after the corporate ##- ##fo ##cus ##ed business was dem ##er ##ged from the consumer side of the Cable & Wireless group in March 2010 .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne , the world ' ##s biggest mobile phone operator , caused ji ##tters among investors yesterday when it lowered its guidance for margins and revenue growth for the current year amid warnings of in ##tens ##ifying competition .
unused ##1 It expects revenue growth of 6 ##- ##9 per cent , down from " high single digits " , and said margins would be flat or down 1 percentage point from 38 ##. ##5 per cent , rather than its earlier guidance of " broadly stable " margins .
unused ##1 The group has signed up 2 ##. ##1 ##m customers using 3 ##G phones and 300 ##, ##00 ##0 data card users since rolling out the latest generation of mobile technology across 13 markets last November .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne added 16 ##. ##3 ##m net customers in the year to March across 26 markets , giving it a customer base of 154 ##. ##8 ##m ##.

V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported revenue of pound ##( ##s ##) ##45 ##. ##9 ##b ##n for the year to March 31 , up 3 ##. ##2 per cent on the previous year , as some of its fast ##- ##gro ##wing businesses in emerging markets offset weakness in southern Europe .
Operating profit excluding one ##- ##off items rose 3 ##. ##1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , notably because of a strong performance by V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which V ##oda ##fo ##ne has a 45 per cent stake .
V ##eri ##zon should benefit from AT ##& ##T ' ##s proposed acquisition of T ##- ##M ##ob ##ile USA from Deutsche Tel ##ek ##om , because consolidation provides the remaining operators with greater pricing power .
unused ##1 Pre ##- ##ta ##x profit increased 9 ##. ##5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##. ##5 ##b ##n and the total divide ##nd rose 7 ##. ##1 per cent to 8 ##. ##9 ##p after a final of 6 ##. ##0 ##5 ##p ( 5 ##. ##65 ##p ) .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported revenue of Pound ##s 31 ##. ##1 ##b ##n for 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 , up 4 ##. ##3 per cent on an organic basis , and adjusted operating profit of Pound ##s 9 ##. ##5 ##b ##n , up 4 ##. ##2 per cent .
unused ##1 It recorded a pre ##- ##ta ##x loss of Pound ##s 2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n , partly because of Pound ##s 11 ##. ##6 ##b ##n of imp ##air ##ment charges that reflected fierce competition and regulatory pressure in some of its core European markets .

In ##ves ##tors welcomed how V ##oda ##fo ##ne will over the next two years raise its divide ##nd above a pay ##out target of 60 per cent of adjusted earnings per share .

Some of V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s main European businesses , such as those in the UK and Spain , are expected to report declining revenue , because consumers are spending less on their mobile phones during the recession .

V ##eri ##zon Wireless stopped issuing divide ##nds in 2005 , after V ##eri ##zon Communications decided to use V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s cash flow to pay down the mobile operator ' ##s debt .

Graham Se ##cker , equity s ##trate ##gis ##t at Morgan Stanley , said V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s share buy ##back , while unusual , may be well timed .
V ##oda ##fo ##ne scaled back its revenue forecast for 2008 ##- ##0 ##9 at its first ##- ##qua ##rter trading update , partly because some people were delay ##ing upgrades of mobile phones .
On March 31 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne had net debt of pound ##( ##s ##) ##25 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.

V ##oda ##fo ##ne shares drop on news of UK profits fall

Meanwhile , V ##oda ##fo ##ne also had a further set ##back in its efforts to secure control of V ##oda ##com , South Africa ' ##s leading mobile operator .

Ana ##ly ##sts broadly agreed that V ##oda ##fo ##ne secured a good price for its stake in SF ##R , given that V ##ive ##ndi - which owned the remaining shares in the group - had been reported to be unwilling to pay more than pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##b ##n ( $ ##9 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ) .
unused ##1 The SF ##R deal will allow V ##oda ##fo ##ne to pay down debt , which , according to Merrill Lynch , will give the company " a huge credit tail ##wind in a sector star ##ved of credit improvement stories " .
V ##eri ##zon Wireless has not paid a divide ##nd since 2005 , after its parent insisted that cash generated be used to pay down debt .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne yesterday said it would double its divide ##nd and further increase its share buy ##back programme in a firm sign that the mobile operator has listened to shareholder demands to raise its cash pay ##outs .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported a 6 per cent rise in underlying group turnover to Pound ##s 16 ##. ##8 ##b ##n for the six months to the end of September as it continued to add users to its global customer base .

For the 12 months to March 31 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported that pre ##- ##ta ##x profit slipped from pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##. ##6 ##b ##n to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ##.

V ##oda ##fo ##ne , which employs 4 ##, ##30 ##0 people in Spain , declined to say how many jobs were at risk at its operations in the country , where revenues fell 11 per cent in the six months to September last year .
In November , V ##oda ##fo ##ne was forced to write down pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##. ##9 ##b ##n from the value of its businesses in Spain , Italy and Greece , dragging the operator to a first ##- ##hal ##f pre ##- ##ta ##x loss of pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##9 ##2 ##m - down from an pound ##( ##s ##) ##8 ##b ##n profit in the year before .

Previously , the joint venture had appeared in the accounts as if it was 100 per cent owned but the new treatment meant V ##oda ##fo ##ne stopped re ##co ##gni ##sing assets that effectively belonged to its partner , pushing net debt higher .
unused ##1 A further Pound ##s 88 ##0 ##m rise in debt came from the re ##c ##lass ##ification of preference shares , which are branded as debt under IF ##RS .

V ##oda ##fo ##ne is buying companies that control 67 per cent of Hu ##tch ##ison E ##ssa ##r from Hu ##tch ##ison Telecommunications International ( H ##TI ##L ) in a deal that gives the Indian operator an enterprise value of Dollar ##s 18 ##. ##8 ##b ##n ( Pound ##s 9 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ) .
After de ##duct ##ing debt at ##tri ##but ##able to certain holding companies , V ##oda ##fo ##ne has agreed to pay Dollar ##s 11 ##. ##1 ##b ##n in cash to H ##TI ##L , which is a subsidiary of Hu ##tch ##ison W ##ham ##po ##a , the Hong Kong ##- ##base ##d conglomerate .

Some investors who were sharply critical of V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s acquisitions strategy last year , after the group warned of slowing growth , yesterday said obtaining control of Hu ##tch ##ison E ##ssa ##r was " a sensible deal " .
Eric ##sson , the mobile hands ##et maker , said nothing new or surprising in its second ##- ##qua ##rter earnings report , but the stock got carried away with the sour mood , tumbling 11 ##. ##1 per cent to SK ##r ##6 ##6 ##. ##80 ##.

V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s senior management has been weighing up a potential bid for the German group , two people with knowledge of the situation told the Financial Times , although they stressed that the UK company had made no decision and had not approached K ##D ##G .
The revelation comes only days after Liberty Global further b ##ols ##tered its role in the European cable market with the acquisition of Virgin Media in the UK .
