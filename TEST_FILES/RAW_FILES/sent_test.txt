unused1 on 6 per cent sales growth .

unused1 Sales volumes in Europe rose 1 per cent following five quarters of declines as the company increased spending on advertising and promotions for the first time in a year .
unused1 For the first half , total sales were steady at EUR19.96bn ( pound(s)17bn ) , while pre-tax profits fell from EUR3.14bn to EUR2.29bn due to one-time disposal profits a year earlier , as well as pension financing and tax charges .

Yesterday , Mr Polman proved that his changes - which include turning round underperforming brands and stepping up the pace of innovation - were making a difference at Unilever as the company beat analysts ' expectations with underlying sales growth of 3.4 per cent and volume growth of 3.6 per cent .
James Edwardes Jones , analyst at Execution , said : " Excellent third-quarter results indicate Unilever is doing what it said it would do . "

Unilever , the maker of Knorr soups and Dove shampoo , said underlying sales grew 4.5 per cent in the third quarter , and operating margins rose 0.2 percentage points to 13.7 per cent after restructuring costs .
unused1 The company attributed the healthy sales growth to a strong performance in emerg- ing markets , which account for 44 per cent of total sales .
unused1 It stressed that all product categories , with the exception of ice cream , were showing sales and profit growth .
Total sales of ice cream fell Euros 70m ( Dollars 101.3m ) in the third quarter compared with a year earlier , with Unilever blaming the decline on a cool European summer .
Analysts were impressed that Unilever had managed to increase profit margins in the face of higher commodity costs , including mineral oil , which Unilever uses in its home and personal care products .
After the sweeping unification of Royal Dutch/ Shell and the earlier successful merger of Reed Elsevier 's management structures , Unilever has only half-grasped its chance .
Its renewed commitment to the brands came as it sold its North American laundry brands for $1.45bn ( pound(s)730m ) to private equity group Vestar Capital Partners .

Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group , plans to spend up to $5.4bn to buy a further slice of Hindustan Unilever , marking the latest swoop by a multinational on an Indian-listed subsidiary and the largest ever acquisition in the country 's consumer goods sector .
That is roughly in line with similar deals carried out by multinationals , most recently drugmaker GlaxoSmith-Kline which late last year lifted its 43.2 per cent stake in its pivotal Indian division , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare , to 75 per cent .
The news came a day after HUL , India 's largest consumer goods company , announced a better-than- expected 15 per cent rise in first quarter net profit .

unused1 In 2004 , a weak first quarter was followed by a recovery in the second quarter .
unused1 The broadcaster is expected to deliver a strong increase in pre-tax profit for 2005 , up from Pounds 255m to Pounds 435m as favourable regulatory judgements are expected to outweigh the impact of declining advertising revenues .
unused1 Turnover is forecast to increase from Pounds 2.08bn to Pounds 2.16bn and earnings per share should rise from 5.32p to about 7.5p.
ITV Consumer , the division that manages its digital initiatives , acquired Friends Reunited late last year and is expected to give some details of how the business has been integrated , including the potential for cross-promotion between television and online .
Unilever looks to clean up in Alberto Culver buy
Unilever 's swoop on Alberto Culver was predominantly greeted with enthusiasm by analysts and investors , with most seeing it as a shrewd move into the fastest-growing sector of the consumer goods industry .
Assuming earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation for 2010 of $259m ( pound(s)163m ) and the small amount of cash held by Alberto Culver , the $3.7bn price tag will mean an enterprise value to ebitda multiple of 14 times .
unused1 It compares favourably with the most recent acquisition in personal care products , that of Reckitt Benckiser taking over SSL International , the maker of Durex condoms and Scholl footcare , in July this year for pound(s)1.5bn.
unused1 The group 's operating margins in the personal care category , which includes haircare , were 15.5 per cent last year , above the group margin of 12.6 per cent .
In the most recent quarter , Unilever 's sales of health personal care goods rose 7.8 per cent to EUR3.6bn ( pound(s)3bn ) , compared with growth of only 3.5 per cent for ice-cream and beverages , and 0.5 per cent for savoury foods , dressings and spreads .
A similar dynamic is at work at Unilever 's rival Reckitt Benckiser , the maker of Cillit Bang cleaner and Finish dishwasher powder , where health and personal care is growing at 14 per cent a year , compared with 8 per cent growth across the whole business .
The personal care business of Sara Lee , acquired last year , was equally weighted toward developed markets , with most of its sales in western Europe , comprising brands such as Radox and Brylcreem .
unused1 In the most recent quarter , underlying sales at Unilever in western Europe fell 2 per cent to EUR1.3bn.
unused1 However , in Asia , Africa and central and eastern Europe , sales rose 8 per cent , to pound(s)4.7bn.
unused1 Household goods ; Shares up 10 % after chief 's statement ; Sales poor but plans to improve volume
Unilever 's first-quarter sales levels were poor , dropping 1.8 per cent , compared to a 1.6 per cent decline in the previous quarter .
Underlying sales growth of 4.8 per cent was stronger than expected as Unilever benefited from price increases pushed through last year .
Western Europe remains a difficult market for Unilever , with sales volumes dropping 3.7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own-label products , particularly in margarine .
Unilever reports 5.5 % sales rise
Unilever 's success in marketing anti-dandruff shampoo to the Russians and Chinese and slimming teas to the French helped the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate report strong full-year sales growth of 5.5 per cent yesterday , underlining its transformation into a more robust company .
unused1 Margins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13.7 per cent .
unused1 Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposals since 2000 have carved out Euros 8bn worth of revenues .
unused1 In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain sluggish .
So while Unilever expects to hit the top end of its 3-5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still lags behind peers .
Unilever sparks strong interest on talk of big dividend
Unilever was in focus yesterday amid talk the consumer goods company could soon announce plans for a large capital return .
Unilever is due to ann-ounce full-year results on February 7 and analysts believe the company may commit to a large dividend increase , a bigger share buy-back or both .

unused1 It would be the second big takeover under his tenure , following on from the $1.9bn deal to acquire the European personal care division of Sara Lee in September last year .
unused1 The proposed price tag values the company , including its small cash pile , at about 14 times the consensus forecast for its 2010 earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of $259m .
For the 12 months ending in June , Alberto Culver made revenues of $1.6bn and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of more than $250m .

Vodafone is expected to say next week that its core profit margin will continue to fall in the current financial year , as the world 's largest mobile phone group by revenue fights fierce competition in its European markets .
Leading industry analysts said Vodafone was likely to indicate at its 2006-07 results presentation on Tuesday that the group 's margin would deteriorate further in the year to March 31 2008 .
Vodafone warned in May last year that its margin on organic adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation should decline by one percentage point in 2006-07 , continuing a trend that began in 2005-06 .
The deteriorating margin position highlighted at Vodafone 's half- year results in November 2005 put pressure on Arun Sarin , the group 's chief executive , although his relations with investors have since recovered .
unused1 In a research note , he estimated revenue of Pounds 31.2bn for 2006-07 , up 6.5 per cent , and ebitda of Pounds 12bn , up 1.8 per cent , delivering a margin of 38.3 per cent .
But Mr Delfas , who has a " buy " rating on Vodafone , calculated the margin would fall to 37.5 per cent in 2007-08 .
Mr Sinclair , who has a " hold " rating on Vodafone , estimated the margin would be 36.4 per cent in 2007-08 , partly because of spending on new customers .

unused1 " With the stock trading below embedded value , and with Asian sales likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next five years , we retain an overweight rating , " the broker , which has a 989p target price , said .
unused1 The weak oil price and a downgrade from RBS did the damage .
unused1 Moving to a " hold " rating , RBS said the lack of commercial success at the Chim Cng well in Vietnam and a six month gap in Premier 's drilling schedule would weigh on the share price .
RBS also cut ratings on Venture Production , off 5.8 per cent to 737 1/2 p , and Salamander Energy , down 5.2 per cent at 250p .
The record payout will be boosted by the pound(s)16.6bn special dividend from Vodafone , the study points out .
unused1 Altogether , the telecoms group is handing shareholders just over pound(s)54bn - almost three-quarters of the net proceeds from the sale of its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless .
Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound(s)2.4bn dividend from US operator Verizon Wireless , in which Vodafone owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with Verizon Communications .
Vodafone 's management will use the cash to fund a pound(s)1.5bn share buy-back programme .
unused1 Cash profits attributable to Vodafone from Verizon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound(s)4.49bn - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2.2 per cent to pound(s)6.2bn.

On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture with Verizon Communications , ruled out regular dividends .
unused1 This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $10bn dividend - its first since 2005 .
It is not a secret that Verizon stopped paying dividends in an effort to force Vodafone to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to Verizon .
But since then Verizon Wireless 's trapped cash has been put to good use repaying its debt and Vodafone and Verizon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) .
unused1 On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1.4 per cent year on year in the second quarter .
But Vodafone 's revenue growth also slowed from first-quarter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3.2 per cent decline in the UK .
unused1 Result : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009-10 .
unused1 First-half earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , at pound(s)6.6bn , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the ebitda margin slipped to 30.5 per cent , compared with 31.2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) .
Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent-owned Verizon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $8.5bn dividend to its two parents .
The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade-off for an earlier payout , and Vodafone will return pound(s)1.5bn to investors via a share buyback .
unused1 The non-European interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1.8 times ebitda .
