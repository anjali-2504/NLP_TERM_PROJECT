unused ##1 Meanwhile , V ##oda ##fo ##ne also had a further set ##back in its efforts to secure control of V ##oda ##com , South Africa ' ##s leading mobile operator .

unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts broadly agreed that V ##oda ##fo ##ne secured a good price for its stake in SF ##R , given that V ##ive ##ndi - which owned the remaining shares in the group - had been reported to be unwilling to pay more than pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##b ##n ( $ ##9 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ) .
unused ##1 The SF ##R deal will allow V ##oda ##fo ##ne to pay down debt , which , according to Merrill Lynch , will give the company " a huge credit tail ##wind in a sector star ##ved of credit improvement stories " .
unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon Wireless has not paid a divide ##nd since 2005 , after its parent insisted that cash generated be used to pay down debt .

unused ##1 The company also raised its share buy ##back programme from Pound ##s 3 ##b ##n to Pound ##s 4 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported a 6 per cent rise in underlying group turnover to Pound ##s 16 ##. ##8 ##b ##n for the six months to the end of September as it continued to add users to its global customer base .
unused ##1 The growth , slightly ahead of consensus expectations , was driven by 7 ##. ##4 ##m new customers in the first half , taking its global base to 146 ##. ##7 ##m ##.
unused ##1 However , some analysts pointed to evidence of a slow ##down in revenue growth in key markets such as Italy , a trend they attributed to increasing competition from new en ##tra ##nts such as 3 .

unused ##1 It blamed regulatory cuts to mobile termination rates - wholesale charges to rival providers for connecting calls - as well as the continued decline in voice revenues .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne said that the pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##1 ##b ##n V ##eri ##zon divide ##nd was " to be retained in the business for general business purposes , including spectrum costs " - a move that q ##ua ##shes speculation of a new share buy ##back scheme after the current programme ex ##pire ##s in July .
