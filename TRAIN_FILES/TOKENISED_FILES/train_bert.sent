unused ##1 Consider Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s performance in fixed income , cu ##rre ##ncies and commodities , where revenue rose 9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n from a year ago .
unused ##1 That suggests Bar ##C ##ap is maintaining , even increasing , its share .
unused ##1 Or take the unit ' ##s e ##quities revenue , up just 1 per cent .
unused ##1 Yet that makes Bar ##C ##ap and Morgan Stanley the only investment banks to report an increase so far .

unused ##1 Barclay ##s ' first ##- ##qua ##rter profit surged by almost 47 per cent , yet its shares slid by more than 6 per cent yesterday .
unused ##1 In part , the strong fixed income , cu ##rre ##ncies and commodities ( F ##IC ##C ) performances from Goldman Sachs , JP ##M ##or ##gan and Deutsche Bank had s ##tok ##ed expectations that Barclay ##s Capital would also shoot the lights out .
unused ##1 But instead , Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue was down 26 per cent on last year , and top ##- ##line income from F ##IC ##C was almost 40 per cent lower , compared with the roughly 10 per cent fall at other investment banks .
unused ##1 Credit Su ##isse ' ##s recent first ##- ##qua ##rter results disappointed for much the same reason .
unused ##1 Although Barclay ##s ' pre ##- ##ta ##x profits rose by 47 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , helped by a sharp fall in imp ##air ##ments , Bar ##C ##ap accounted for more than four ##- ##fi ##ft ##hs of them .
unused ##1 Given that the market conditions of the first two quarters of last year are unlikely to be repeated , another way to see Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue decline is as setting a more normal quarterly run ##- ##rate of pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ##- ##po ##und ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##b ##n , Credit Su ##isse notes .
unused ##1 For a bank that has had a trick ##y year in its core UK retail business , Barclay ##s ' 15 per cent jump in full year pre ##- ##ta ##x profits looks impressive .
unused ##1 This does not mean that all in the domestic garden is r ##osy : performance was shore ##d up by strong earnings growth at Barclay ##s Capital , the investment banking arm , and B ##GI , the global fund management business .

unused ##1 Overall , Bar ##C ##ap ' ##s revenue fell 15 per cent from a year ago .
unused ##1 Given the 8 ##. ##1 per cent achieved in the normally strong first quarter , that looks like a stretch .
unused ##1 E ##ar ##ning ##s recovery , and the ability to generate capital internally , could take longer than expected - earnings forecast ##s for 2013 are a fifth lower than they were two years ago .

unused ##1 BA ##SF , advised by ##L ##azar ##d , initially hesitated to pay more than EU ##R ##3 ##b ##n as it was wary of being seen to be over ##pa ##ying after its acquisition of C ##iba drew criticism .
unused ##1 BA ##SF was one of the region ' ##s biggest winners , rising 7 ##. ##4 per cent to EU ##R ##40 ##. ##6 ##1 after surprising the market with better than expected third quarter results .
unused ##1 The world ' ##s largest chemical maker said earnings before interest and taxes excluding one ##- ##time write ##- ##offs rose 9 ##. ##5 per cent quarter over quarter to EU ##R ##1 ##. ##25 ##b ##n , beating consensus expectations of a 9 per cent decline .

unused ##1 For the full year 2008 , sales rose 7 ##. ##5 per cent to EU ##R ##6 ##2 ##. ##3 ##b ##n , a result of higher oil prices , while earnings before interest and taxes slipped 11 ##. ##7 per cent to EU ##R ##6 ##. ##5 ##b ##n and net profit tumbled 28 ##. ##4 per cent to EU ##R ##2 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ##.

unused ##1 It is no wonder quarterly operating profits more than doubled to Euro ##s 1 ##b ##n on a one ##- ##fi ##ft ##h gain in revenues , beating all forecast ##s .
unused ##1 Meanwhile , it expects to exceed its cost of capital ( which it puts at a very high 10 per cent ) this year , which should pro ##mpt a divide ##nd increase and even more share buy ##backs .
unused ##1 But , in spite of sur ##ging profits , chairman Ju ##rgen Ham ##brecht seems determined to avoid any hint of drunken e ##up ##hor ##ia .

unused ##1 BA ##SF , the world ' ##s largest chemicals company , said yesterday the global manufacturing s ##lump dragged its first ##- ##qua ##rter sales down by a quarter and wiped two ##- ##thi ##rds off net profit , forcing it to broad ##en cost and job cuts .

unused ##1 Operating income would come in " sharply " below last year ' ##s EU ##R ##6 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ##.

unused ##1 Net profit slipped 68 per cent to EU ##R ##37 ##5 ##m as prices for its products eroded .

unused ##1 But Un ##ile ##ver said its competitive position had improved over the past six months , with sales growing 2 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier , excluding the impact of extra trading days .

unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts at Le ##hman Brothers are expecting the company to report about 1 ##. ##5 ##m 3 ##G subscribers at the end of March .

unused ##1 The picture was even worse at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s Turkish business , where revenue fell by 14 ##. ##5 per cent .

unused ##1 JP ##M ##or ##gan C ##az ##eno ##ve , joint broker to Te ##sco , is forecast ##ing a 1 ##. ##5 per cent decline in UK sales from stores open at least a year , in the six weeks to January 7 , representing a sharp de ##ter ##ior ##ation from the previous reported trading period .

unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s recovery path to start with sales dip
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s UK underlying sales are set to fall in the first quarter , despite chief executive Philip Clarke ' ##s recovery plan for the retailer ' ##s domestic business .
unused ##1 In April , Mr Clarke set out a strategic blue ##print for Britain ' ##s biggest supermarket chain by market share after its first profit warning in 20 years .
unused ##1 However , City analysts still forecast a decline in sales from Te ##sco UK stores open at least a year when the retailer reports on June 11 .
unused ##1 Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , expects a decline in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales of 1 ##- ##2 per cent year on year , excluding fuel and VA ##T , in the retailer ' ##s first quarter .
unused ##1 With inflation of about 2 ##. ##5 per cent , the volume of goods sold would be down 3 ##- ##4 per cent .
unused ##1 Andrew Ka ##so ##uli ##s , analyst at Credit Su ##isse , forecast ##s a 1 ##. ##5 per cent decline .
unused ##1 This compares with a 1 ##. ##6 per cent drop in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the fourth quarter to the end of February , although it is an improvement on the 2 ##. ##3 per cent decline over Christmas and the new year , Te ##sco ' ##s worst performance for decades .
unused ##1 Mr Black said the first ##- ##qua ##rter performance would be in line with expectations , as Te ##sco was just starting to implement the changes Mr Clarke talked about in April , such as putting more staff into supermarket ##s and introducing improved ready meals .
unused ##1 " We would not be expecting Te ##sco to be doing anything other than performing in line with the fourth quarter , slightly under ##per ##form ##ing the industry .
unused ##1 " While we think there probably has been some underlying sales improvement , aided by the very high level of money ##- ##off coup ##ons , we think April was weak [ impacted by the weather ] and the calendar will not un ##wind until the second quarter , " said Mr Ka ##so ##uli ##s in a note .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts expect group sales to rise 9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##9 ##b ##n , and pre ##- ##ta ##x profit to rise more than 6 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Bernstein Research has pencil ##led in operating profits of pound ##( ##s ##) ##26 ##3 ##m , or 10 per cent of the UK operating profit , for the year to March .
unused ##1 Results in Te ##sco ' ##s international business - Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities expects revenues to be 13 ##. ##4 per cent higher at pound ##( ##s ##) ##18 ##. ##3 ##b ##n - will be mixed , with continental Europe hard hit .
unused ##1 Shore Capital expects profits there , given the struggles of economies such as the Irish Republic and Hungary , to be down 10 per cent .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts are also pencil ##ling in more losses at Fresh & Easy , Te ##sco ' ##s US convenience chain , although Clive Black of Shore Capital thinks the chain might have reached its na ##dir .
unused ##1 Nine months into a plan to overhaul the UK business and one year after its profit warning , Te ##sco ' ##s Christmas sales figures look relatively under ##w ##hel ##ming .
unused ##1 In the six weeks to January 5 , group like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales excluding petrol were up 0 ##. ##3 per cent .
unused ##1 UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales , excluding petrol and strip ##ping out sales from Club ##card v ##ou ##chers , were broadly in line with expectations , rising 1 ##. ##4 per cent , boost ##ed by better food and online sales .
unused ##1 But broker Seymour Pierce points out that this is a poor return considering Te ##sco has invested 1 per cent of its tight margin this financial year to achieve it , following a profit warning a year ago after the group ' ##s dire performance at Christmas 2011 .
unused ##1 Like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in Asia and central Europe continued to decline , while in the US , where Te ##sco is reviewing its Fresh & Easy business , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales fell 2 ##. ##1 per cent .
unused ##1 As its 10 per cent increase in first half profits yesterday showed , Te ##sco is about as safe as things come in these uncertain , paranoid times .
unused ##1 UK underlying sales growth of 3 ##. ##7 per cent la ##gs behind more price ##- ##ori ##ent ##ated competitors such as Morrison ##s and W ##al ##- ##M ##art ' ##s As ##da , even if the threat from " deep " discount ##ers such as Al ##di is exaggerated .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s 4 per cent higher non ##- ##food sales came from a significant , un ##sp ##ec ##ified , space rise ##- meaning sales den ##sities fell .
unused ##1 International ##ly , sales growth of 1 per cent from stores open at least a year is under ##w ##hel ##ming , given the amount of space added .
unused ##1 Under ##lying sales were flat last year and profit margins declined slightly .
unused ##1 Success overseas is patch ##y ( the US business is still bleeding cash ; the Chinese one has not broken even as quickly as Te ##sco expected ) but overall trading profit rose 11 per cent in Europe and 30 per cent in Asia .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s net debt is not that large , but capital expenditure is high .
unused ##1 The divide ##nd pay ##out works out at only about a third of that but , as promised last year , the 11 per cent increase in the interim divide ##nd is in line with earnings growth , boost ##ed by profits from property sales .
unused ##1 These reached Pound ##s 74 ##m in the first half and are expected to continue a ##pace , as Te ##sco reduces the amount of property it owns from 85 per cent to about 70 per cent of its portfolio .
unused ##1 The group ' ##s share buy ##- ##back programme is now running , though the Pound ##s 1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n targeted over the next five years is ins ##ign ##ificant in the context of the company ' ##s near Pound ##s 30 ##b ##n capital ##isation .
unused ##1 Still , a divide ##nd yield approaching 2 ##. ##8 per cent this year seems acceptable for a company investing heavily in growth opportunities .
unused ##1 In the UK , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth in the second quarter of 6 ##. ##6 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar looks roughly in line , rather than ahead of competitors .
unused ##1 Yesterday ' ##s first ##- ##hal ##f results were at ##ro ##cious , with profits for the UK company down in almost all areas of the business .
unused ##1 The rate of decline in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales slowed in the second quarter against the first - from 1 ##. ##1 per cent to 0 ##. ##8 per cent - as a turn ##rou ##nd plan that involves back ##- ##to ##- ##bas ##ics wisdom such as low prices , more welcoming stores and higher staff ##ing took effect .
unused ##1 That is a decent start but it can not yet be counted as evidence that January ' ##s profit warning was a b ##lip rather than the start of a long , Carr ##ef ##our ##- ##style decline .
unused ##1 On 10 times forecast earnings , Te ##sco is at a discount to the likes of Sai ##ns ##bury ( 12 ) and W ##al ##mart ( 14 ) .
unused ##1 But Te ##sco is no longer the growth story it once was and bargain hunters should hold off until there is more evidence of a recovery than one quarter of improvement in like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales numbers .
unused ##1 The UK business , its main earnings engine , increased trading profit by 5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##3 ##b ##n on sales 6 per cent higher .
unused ##1 Strip out the effect of new stores , however , and sales excluding petrol and value added tax fell by 0 ##. ##5 per cent , mostly in the second quarter .
unused ##1 The outlook is g ##loom ##ier : Te ##sco predict ##s flat profit in the second half from a year ago .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s Asian and European operations , where first ##- ##hal ##f trading profit rose 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively , should continue to ease the pain .
unused ##1 Group trading profit , which rose by 3 ##. ##7 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , would have been 4 ##. ##5 percentage points higher without a pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##7 ##m one ##- ##off provision for personal protection insurance mi ##s ##- ##sel ##ling claims .
unused ##1 Te ##sco has little to show for the pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n it has spent in the US , other than pound ##( ##s ##) ##80 ##0 ##m of accumulated losses and a 200 ##- ##sto ##re estate that struggled to attract shop ##pers .
unused ##1 With the core UK business struggling ( like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the UK fell 1 ##. ##2 per cent in the third quarter ) , the company is becoming increasingly f ##rug ##al and picking its targets far more carefully .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s lack ##lus ##tre UK sales growth is concerning when competitors J Sai ##ns ##bury ( expected to report b ##uo ##yan ##t figures today ) and W ##m Morrison have accelerated like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like growth through the recession .
unused ##1 Deep discount ##ers ' market share gains have ground to a halt , and with the anniversary of discount brands ' launch now passed , Te ##sco says its UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth has " con ##ver ##ged with the industry " .
unused ##1 Prof ##it growth was also tempered by higher interest costs after Te ##sco acquired Korea ' ##s Home ##ver chain for pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##5 ##8 ##m and bought out Royal Bank of Scotland ' ##s 50 per cent share in their financial services joint venture for pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##50 ##m last year .
unused ##1 International sales - now one ##- ##thi ##rd of Te ##sco ' ##s total - should accelerate as markets in central Europe and Asia pull out of the do ##ld ##rum ##s .
unused ##1 Food & DR ##U ##G Re ##tail ##ers ; Group says it is catching UK rivals ; International sales b ##uo ##y first quarter
unused ##1 Te ##sco insisted it was narrowing the gap on faster ##- ##gro ##wing UK rivals W ##m Morrison , J Sai ##ns ##bury and As ##da , as international sales b ##uo ##yed its first ##- ##qua ##rter performance .
unused ##1 The comments come ahead of first ##- ##qua ##rter figures today from Sai ##ns ##bury , which are expected to reveal a 6 ##. ##4 per cent increase in like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales .
unused ##1 De ##mand for non ##- ##food items was also picking up , with " modest " like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth re ##suming in recent weeks .
unused ##1 Group sales for the 13 weeks to May 30 rose 9 ##. ##7 per cent including petrol , and 12 ##. ##6 per cent excluding such sales .
unused ##1 International sales rose 20 ##. ##1 per cent , or 11 ##. ##4 per cent at constant exchange rates , boost ##ed by Asian markets , but held back by Ireland where Te ##sco has been trying to stem the flow of cross ##- ##bor ##der shop ##pers seeking bargain ##s in Northern Ireland .
unused ##1 Sales in the US - where Te ##sco has been forced to slow its expansion plans - almost triple ##d , although Mr M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e acknowledged that the US operation was an " im ##mat ##ure and small business " .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s personal finance operation contributed 2 ##. ##2 percentage points to overall UK sales growth of 9 ##. ##3 per cent .
unused ##1 " The customer count is increasing steadily , " said Mr M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e .
unused ##1 Second , price ##- ##led formats are thriving - Al ##di , the German ##- ##own ##ed discount ##er , says total UK sales rose 22 per cent in December .
unused ##1 The step ##- ##up in its Christmas sales from the previous quarter suggests the initiative is paying off - and could start den ##ting the currently superior performance of rival supermarket groups Sai ##ns ##bury , W ##m Morrison , and W ##al ##- ##M ##art ' ##s As ##da .
unused ##1 Te ##sco led the wider market lower after reporting weaker than expected non ##- ##food sales over Christmas .
unused ##1 Dixon ##s Re ##tail also blamed the pre ##- ##C ##hr ##ist ##mas snow for a profit warning , sending its shares down 10 per cent to 21 1 ##/ ##4 p ##.
unused ##1 But A ##rgo ##s owner Home Re ##tail Group bounced 10 ##. ##2 per cent to 227 ##p amid short covering after its holiday sales proved better than feared .
unused ##1 Car ins ##urer Admiral Group took on 2 ##. ##9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##15 ##. ##6 ##9 , helped by " buy " advice from Red ##burn Partners .
unused ##1 So much for record Pound ##s 2 ##b ##n profit , gang ##buster sales growth and a market share above 30 per cent .
unused ##1 However , most analysts expect underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 per cent , which would be up to Pound ##s 900 ##m more than Te ##sco officially budget ##ed for .
unused ##1 Some already have their eye on Pound ##s 3 ##b ##n in profit in coming years .
unused ##1 Boots , which last week reported a 11 ##. ##4 per cent decline in profit before exceptional ##s to Pound ##s 48 ##1 ##m , is one of the many retailers that has been hit by the march of supermarket ##s into the health and beauty market .
unused ##1 Morgan Stanley re ##iter ##ated its " buy " recommendation and 380 ##p price target on the stock .

unused ##1 Sc ##hr ##ode ##rs recorded its biggest fall in four years , sliding 9 ##. ##5 per cent to 87 ##2 ##p after the banking group unveiled an unexpected drop in funds under management in the second quarter .
unused ##1 Tea ##ther & Greenwood cut its recommendation on the stock from " buy " to " hold " , saying it was concerned over the level of UK institutional out ##flow ##s at the fund management group - a " th ##orn in the company ' ##s side " , according to the broker .
unused ##1 On the upside , steel ##maker Co ##rus advanced 1 ##. ##6 per cent to 38 ##8 1 ##/ 4 ##p as record third quarter numbers from European peer T ##hy ##ssen ##k ##rup ##p encouraged buyers .
unused ##1 B ##io ##fu ##els rallied 6 per cent to 96 ##p as Collins Stewart , house broker , reminded investors that the bio ##dies ##el producer was now cash genera ##tive and repeated its 135 ##p price target .
unused ##1 According to industry data from Ka ##nta ##r World ##pan ##el , the consumer research group , Te ##sco experienced stronger than expected sales growth over the past four weeks .
unused ##1 In the four weeks to November 25 , sales through Te ##sco ' ##s till ##s rose 2 ##. ##7 per cent year on year , ahead of the market at 2 ##. ##5 per cent , and making it the fastest growing of the so ##- ##cal ##led big four supermarket ##s .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s grocery sales rose 5 ##. ##2 per cent in the four weeks to November 25 , according to Ka ##nta ##r , compared with the market at 3 ##. ##1 per cent , indicating that the retailer ' ##s performance is being dragged down by sales of non ##- ##food items .
unused ##1 The brighter picture comes ahead of today ' ##s third ##- ##qua ##rter update , when it is forecast to report flat to slightly negative sales growth for the three months to the end of November .
unused ##1 This is a slow ##down from the second quarter , when Te ##sco had its first rise in UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales for two years , up 0 ##. ##1 per cent in the three months to the end of August .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts at Deutsche Bank , joint broker to Te ##sco , forecast a 0 ##. ##8 per cent decline in Te ##sco ' ##s UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the third quarter , driven mostly by weakness in non ##- ##food , while Shore Capital forecast ##s flat sales to a 1 per cent decline .
unused ##1 However , Dave McCarthy , analyst at In ##ves ##tec Securities , said it was possible Te ##sco ' ##s sales could be better than forecast , as recent trading will have been " flat ##tered by the timing and nature of promotions " .
unused ##1 Te ##sco is also facing head ##wind ##s from overseas , with like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in its loss ##making US business forecast to rise by 4 ##- ##5 per cent , according to Shore Capital .
unused ##1 This would be only marginal ##ly ahead of the 3 ##. ##6 per cent increase in the first quarter , regarded as disappointing by the market .
unused ##1 While Te ##sco experienced better trading in the past four weeks , sales growth slowed at J Sai ##ns ##bury , from 5 ##. ##3 per cent in October to 1 ##. ##4 per cent in November .
unused ##1 Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s grocery sales rose by 1 per cent .
unused ##1 W ##m Morrison sales fell 1 ##. ##7 per cent in November , according to Ka ##nta ##r .
unused ##1 In a year pepper ##ed with job losses , profit warnings and missed targets , Te ##sco managed to b ##uck the wider ma ##lai ##se in the retail ##ing sector and provided the high point of 2005 when it became the first UK retailer to break the Pound ##s 2 ##b ##n profit barrier .
unused ##1 R ##ival W ##m Morrison ' ##s w ##oes were some of the most prominent stories of the year ##as the UK ' ##s fourth ##- ##lar ##ges ##t supermarket struggled with the integration of its Pound ##s 3 ##. ##3 ##b ##n acquisition of Safe ##way in March 2004 .
unused ##1 The Bradford ##- ##base ##d retailer , led by 74 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Sir Ken Morrison , g ##rap ##pled with four profit warnings in a few months as the management team was forced to admit its internal accounting team could not cope with the enlarged business .
unused ##1 Then , over in Leeds , Andy Bond , As ##da ' ##s chief executive , announced that the UK ' ##s second ##- ##lar ##ges ##t supermarket group was also in trouble as it missed two consecutive quarters of internal sales and profit targets .

unused ##1 JP ##M ##or ##gan said the a ##c ##quist ##ion gave Te ##sco a chance to close the gap on Shin ##se ##ga ##e ' ##s E ##- ##mart , which has sales of Won ##9 ##, ##00 ##0 ##b ##n ( Pound ##s ? ? b ##n ) , against Te ##sco ' ##s Won ##5 ##, ##90 ##0 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 Te ##sco chief cautious despite store ' ##s pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##1 ##b ##n record profit
unused ##1 In the midst of the worst recession of a generation , Sir Terry Leah ##y proved his ca ##li ##bre once again yesterday as he over ##came the obvious obstacles to deliver yet another year of record profits and growth at Te ##sco .
unused ##1 Against the backdrop of a global down ##turn , trading profit rose 8 ##. ##8 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##1 ##b ##n ( $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ) .
unused ##1 As consumers across many of Te ##sco ' ##s 14 markets tighten their belts , it lifted group sales by 13 ##. ##5 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##60 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 Even in the UK , where Te ##sco ' ##s underlying sales growth of 3 per cent for the year is clearly la ##gging rivals W ##m Morrison and As ##da , Sir Terry still turned in a best ##- ##in ##- ##c ##lass trading margin of 6 ##. ##2 per cent , helped by some craft ##y cost ##- ##cut ##ting ( to the tune of pound ##( ##s ##) ##5 ##40 ##m in the past financial year ) .
unused ##1 First , the retailer ' ##s net debt has balloon ##ed to pound ##( ##s ##) ##9 ##. ##6 ##b ##n from pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##2 ##b ##n in the past year .
unused ##1 Instead of breaking even this year , Te ##sco is now looking at another year of losses .
unused ##1 Having committed to invest up to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##25 ##b ##n in the chain in the five years to 2012 , Fresh & Easy , rack ##ed up another pound ##( ##s ##) ##14 ##0 ##m of losses this year .
unused ##1 Philip Clarke , chief executive of Te ##sco , claimed an early victory in his pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n battle to turn round Te ##sco ' ##s UK business after a profit warning a year ago , as he confirmed a re ##shu ##ffle of his top team .
unused ##1 The retailer said UK sales rose 1 ##. ##8 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the six weeks to January 5 , on a " like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like " basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and the VA ##T sales tax .
unused ##1 The Christmas trading figures were much better than Te ##sco ' ##s dire performance over the same six ##- ##week period a year earlier , when it posted a like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales decline of 2 ##. ##3 per cent in the UK .
unused ##1 That set ##back prompted the group ' ##s first profit warning in two decades and a subsequent commitment to invest pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n in turning round the UK business .
unused ##1 He said Te ##sco had been gal ##vani ##sed to produce a better performance after the shock of the profit warning last year .
unused ##1 Te ##sco said like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in Europe fell 3 ##. ##6 per cent , and 2 ##. ##1 per cent in the US .
unused ##1 Like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in Asia fell 0 ##. ##2 per cent .
unused ##1 Fresh & Easy business put on notice by Clarke ; Re ##tail ##er reports 12 % fall in pre ##- ##ta ##x profit
unused ##1 Philip Clarke , chief executive of Te ##sco , issued an ul ##ti ##mat ##um to Fresh & Easy , its struggling US business , as he unveiled the retailer ' ##s first fall in pre ##- ##ta ##x profits for almost 20 years .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke , who also reported Te ##sco ' ##s first increase in under ##- ##lying UK sales for almost two years , said Fresh & Easy needed to " persuade " him it had a future with the group .
unused ##1 He said Fresh & Easy had " stumbled " in the first half , disappointing with losses of pound ##( ##s ##) ##7 ##4 ##m , broadly the same as last year .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke ' ##s comments came as a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n investment to turn round Te ##sco ' ##s UK business , plus a decline in international earnings , cut group pre ##- ##ta ##x profits by 12 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##6 ##6 ##b ##n in the six months to August 25 , the first fall for 18 years .
unused ##1 However , Mr Clarke was able to point to some improvement in the UK , which in January was the source of the group ' ##s first profit warning in 20 years . .
unused ##1 Sales from UK stores open at least a year rose 0 ##. ##1 per cent in the second quarter , excluding fuel and value added tax , against a 1 ##. ##5 per cent decline in the first quarter and a 2 ##. ##3 per cent fall over the crucial Christmas and New Year period .
unused ##1 However , this was overs ##had ##owed by J Sai ##ns ##bury , which reported better than expected like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 1 ##. ##9 per cent , excluding fuel and VA ##T .
unused ##1 Te ##sco was hit by falling earnings in the UK , Europe and Asia , after regulatory changes in South Korea , its biggest business outside its home market .

unused ##1 The news led Merrill to trim its profit forecast for the division by Pound ##s 11 ##m , although it left full year group forecast ##s unchanged at Pound ##s 2 ##. ##32 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s international business , which accounted for one ##- ##fi ##ft ##h of Te ##sco ' ##s Pound ##s 37 ##. ##1 ##b ##n sales last year , was also " performing well " , with underlying sales up 5 ##. ##5 per cent .

unused ##1 This is an improvement on the final quarter of the 2010 ##- ##20 ##11 financial year , when like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales fell by 0 ##. ##7 per cent .
unused ##1 Te ##sco was the fastest growing of the big four supermarket ##s during the period , expanding sales by 10 ##. ##5 per cent .
unused ##1 J Sai ##ns ##bury is also due to report its first ##- ##qua ##rter sales on Wednesday .

unused ##1 The supermarket group has suffered several down ##grade ##s to profit forecast ##s as a result of restrictions imposed on big retailers ' store opening hours in South Korea , which are expected to hit its sales and profits .

unused ##1 Mr Black noted that the group faced other pressures outside its UK heart ##land , including a sharp slow ##down in sales growth at Fresh & Easy , its loss ##making US business .
unused ##1 He has cut his forecast of Te ##sco ' ##s pre ##- ##ta ##x profit excluding property profits this year by 5 ##. ##6 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##. ##35 ##b ##n , to reflect lower expectations for Korea , the US , central Europe and the UK .
unused ##1 At the same time , Mr Black has raised his forecast of losses at Fresh & Easy by pound ##( ##s ##) ##13 ##m to pound ##( ##s ##) ##10 ##3 ##. ##3 ##m for this year .

unused ##1 But C ##iti blamed the earnings s ##lump on Te ##sco ' ##s expansion programme , which it said was creating " adverse sales leverage " .

unused ##1 At a group level , sales and profits in the six months to the end of August were all heading in the right direction , driven by a recovery in many of Te ##sco ' ##s international markets in central Europe and in Asia .
unused ##1 Indeed , Sir Terry was able to reveal a 12 ##. ##5 per cent increase in first ##- ##hal ##f pre ##- ##ta ##x profit to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##6 ##b ##n , on sales excluding VA ##T up 7 ##. ##1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##29 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , as economies recovered in Asia and Europe .

unused ##1 In consequence , the sale ##- ##and ##- ##lea ##se ##backs that generated pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n in profits from the mid ##- ##19 ##90 ##s will no longer support earnings .
unused ##1 But Mr Clarke has at least attempted to con ##fine this to a range : mid single ##- ##di ##git trading profit growth delivering a return of 12 to 15 per cent on capital , which will be invested at a rate of 3 ##. ##5 to 4 per cent of sales .

unused ##1 The other talking point will be Te ##sco ' ##s net debt , which although still manage ##able is likely to exceed the group ' ##s previous target of pound ##( ##s ##) ##8 ##b ##n and could stunt short ##- ##ter ##m store growth .

unused ##1 The supermarket group unveiled a 12 ##. ##2 per cent rise in sales in the 14 weeks to November 20 , the strongest quarterly performance in five years , as it won market share in a fiercely competitive UK market and pushed harder into eastern Europe and Asia .
unused ##1 But like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales at Te ##sco ' ##s core UK business accelerated 9 ##. ##8 per cent in the third quarter , rising from 8 ##. ##8 per cent in the second quarter and 7 ##. ##8 per cent in the first three months .
unused ##1 Te ##sco , which now pockets Pound ##s 1 of every Pound ##s 8 spent in the UK retail market , saw total UK sales growth of 12 ##. ##3 per cent .
unused ##1 " These are stunning ##ly good results , " said Richard Rat ##ner , an analyst at Seymour Pierce , who inch ##ed up his full ##- ##ye ##ar pre ##- ##ta ##x profit forecast from Pound ##s 2 ##. ##01 ##b ##n to Pound ##s 2 ##. ##0 ##2 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Ex ##c ##lu ##ding petrol sales , like ##- for ##- ##like UK growth was 7 ##. ##5 per cent .
unused ##1 But sales at Te ##sco ' ##s international operations , which account for more than half of total floor space and about a fifth of sales , came in slightly below some analysts ' forecast ##s .
unused ##1 Turn ##over grew 11 ##. ##9 per cent , or 18 ##. ##2 per cent strip ##ping out currency effects .
unused ##1 Ex ##c ##lu ##ding Japan , where Te ##sco made a second acquisition earlier this year , international sales were " broadly similar to the first half " .
unused ##1 An hour after reporting a collapse in European earnings on Wednesday , Te ##sco shares had lost nearly 5 per cent .
unused ##1 Second , with Te ##sco valued at 20 per cent below the long ##- ##ter ##m average at only 13 times 2014 earnings , investors were already pricing in further disappointment ##s .
unused ##1 A profit warning from William Hill suggested that investors were anti ##ci ##pating bad news more accurately than analysts .
unused ##1 The book ##maker ' ##s alert of a pound ##( ##s ##) ##20 ##m hit to quarterly earnings , largely from un ##fa ##vour ##able football results , lifted its stock 0 ##. ##4 per cent to 41 ##3 ##p .
unused ##1 Talk of potential acquisitions by Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser , down 0 ##. ##3 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##43 ##. ##90 , were given another airing .
unused ##1 It played down fears that emerging markets had deteriorated further , and dismissed the idea that W ##PP might react to the Public ##is ##- ##O ##m ##nic ##om merger with its own me ##ga deal .
unused ##1 Mr Higgins ##on raised a cool Pound ##s 1 ##m through the sale of 231 ##, ##8 ##8 ##7 shares in Te ##sco at 46 ##4 ##p , after the shares had bounced 7 per cent on Sir Terry ' ##s comments that were surprisingly bull ##ish despite d ##rea ##ry summer sales reported with the retailer ' ##s first ##- ##hal ##f results this week .
unused ##1 Te ##sco starts sales fight ##back with new v ##ou ##cher campaign
unused ##1 Last week Te ##sco reported its worst domestic sales performance for decades and issued its first profit warning in 20 years , after its " Big Price Drop " failed to revive sales over the Christmas and new year trading period .
unused ##1 The move comes after Philip Clarke , chief executive , blamed a f ##ero ##cious fight ##back from rival supermarket ##s for the 2 ##. ##3 per cent decline in Te ##sco ' ##s UK sales from stores open at least a year , as its big competitors bomb ##arded customers with v ##ou ##chers and coup ##ons .
unused ##1 " There was a lot of promotional coup ##oning going on around Christmas , " Mr Clarke said when the profit warning was announced last Thursday .
unused ##1 Last month the retailer showed it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as it reported the first slow ##down in underlying sales growth for two years .
unused ##1 Overall sales in the UK rose 11 ##. ##6 per cent in the third quarter .
unused ##1 Growth in non ##- ##food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double ##- ##di ##git ##s .
unused ##1 However , the market , which has become used to Te ##sco significantly out ##per ##form ##ing its rivals , gave a l ##uke ##warm response to the figures , which showed under ##- ##lying sales up 5 ##. ##7 per cent in the seven weeks to January 7 with volumes up 7 ##. ##2 per cent .
unused ##1 With like ##- for ##- ##like volumes up 7 ##. ##2 per cent , to have held these gains and to have seen no switching back ( by customers ) to Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s , we are really pleased . "
unused ##1 J Sai ##ns ##bury showed a 5 ##. ##2 per cent rise in underlying sales in the third quarter .
unused ##1 " On identical space , Sai ##ns ##bury ' ##s like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like gain will have been better than Te ##sco ' ##s for the first time in a very long time , " Mr Fowler wrote .
unused ##1 Te ##sco ' ##s total sales over the period grew 11 ##. ##5 per cent against 12 ##. ##1 per cent last year .
unused ##1 The international business , which accounts for just over one ##- fifth of profits , had a slow ##down in sales , which rose 16 ##. ##1 per cent over the period .
unused ##1 They rose 23 ##. ##3 per cent in the previous quarter .
unused ##1 Full ##- ##ye ##ar profit forecast ##s are unchanged at Pound ##s 2 ##. ##1 ##b ##n ##- ##P ##ou ##nds 2 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Te ##sco said yesterday it was feeling the effects of the consumer slow ##down in its home market as Britain ' ##s biggest retail chain failed to match up to sales expectations .
unused ##1 Te ##sco said conditions had been more difficult over Christmas , but it enjoyed a 3 ##. ##1 per cent lift in underlying sales - against expectations of 4 ##- ##4 ##. ##5 per cent - in the six weeks to January 5 .
unused ##1 He said central Europe had delivered a 30 per cent sales up ##lift .
unused ##1 Overall the international business , which now accounts for nearly a quarter of group sales and a fifth of profits , enjoyed sales growth of 26 ##. ##9 per cent .
unused ##1 The I ##G ##D , the food research body , said yesterday that it expected Te ##sco ' ##s international turnover to increase by Pound ##s 30 ##b ##n ( Dollar ##s 59 ##b ##n ) to Pound ##s 74 ##b ##n by 2012 .
unused ##1 At a press brief ##ing to un ##ve ##il Te ##sco ' ##s joint venture in China , Frank Lai , finance director of China Resources Enterprise , was keen to praise his new partner .
unused ##1 After a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##b ##n investment in the UK to counter ##act di ##sma ##l domestic trading , and deals to exit the US and partially China , the retailer is now fighting another fire in central Europe , where profits have collapsed .
unused ##1 After its first profit warning in 20 years in January 2012 , Te ##sco set out plans to overhaul the UK , and chief executive Philip Clarke said this was beginning to work .
unused ##1 Sales from UK stores open at least a year were flat on the year ##- ##ear ##lier period in the three months to the end of August , compared with a 1 per cent decline in the preceding quarter .
unused ##1 Indeed , trading profit in central Europe slumped 70 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##55 ##m , compared with analysts ' forecast ##s of about pound ##( ##s ##) ##13 ##0 ##m .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke revealed that sales of Te ##sco ' ##s tablet , the Hu ##dl , which went on sale on Monday , were better than forecast , helped by a higher staff discount this week .
unused ##1 Prof ##it warning
unused ##1 Te ##sco shares plunged yesterday after the UK retailer issued a profit warning in the wake of disappointing Christmas trading in its UK heart ##land .
unused ##1 Mr Clarke said its growth ambitions in non ##- ##food items could be increasingly satisfied through internet sales rather than building more " big box " stores .
unused ##1 Sales in the six weeks to January 7 were down 2 ##. ##3 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the UK on a like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and value added tax .
unused ##1 This was weaker than the 0 ##. ##9 per cent decline posted in the third quarter of its financial year , which ended in November .
unused ##1 Te ##sco said it now expected to deliver " minimal " growth in trading profit and underlying pre ##- ##ta ##x profit in its next financial year , compared with the 10 per cent growth anticipated by the market .
unused ##1 Laurie M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e , finance director , said recently that there were signs of improvement at Fresh & Easy after the business was re ##lau ##nched , with sales rising 37 ##. ##4 per cent in the third quarter , and also stronger like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales .
unused ##1 Consequently , Te ##sco ex ##- ##pect ##s the business to make a loss over the full year close to its $ ##25 ##9 ##m ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##0 ##m ) deficit of last year .
unused ##1 Te ##sco has also put an expansion into northern California on hold but has continued to acquire sites in central to northern California .
unused ##1 Ms Neville ##- ##R ##ol ##fe also points out that Te ##sco , which operates in 14 countries , has international opportunities elsewhere .
unused ##1 She points to China , which will be a big focus for Te ##sco this year , and India .
unused ##1 " Now those wheels are back on and , if anything , Te ##sco is a little bit of a lean ##er , mean ##er machine , capable of going faster in terms of paying down debt and focusing on the business . "
unused ##1 Another issue facing Te ##sco is whether it can re ##cap ##ture its p ##oise in the UK grocery market , which accounts for more than two ##- ##thi ##rds of its profits and sales .
unused ##1 For much of 2009 it la ##gged behind its main rivals in terms of UK sales growth based on stores open at least a year .
unused ##1 In spite of the Club ##card assault , Te ##sco ' ##s UK like ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the three months to the end of November rose by 2 ##. ##8 per cent , less than expectations .
unused ##1 Mr M ##c ##I ##l ##we ##e says Te ##sco ' ##s third ##- ##qua ##rter sales covered a period when spiral ##ling increases in food prices came to an end .
unused ##1 Andrew Ka ##so ##uli ##s , analyst at Credit Su ##isse , is forecast ##ing UK like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales growth of 3 per cent for the six weeks to January 9 , in line with J Sai ##ns ##bury for the third quarter .
unused ##1 " If Te ##sco counts these as cash sales in its Christmas trading statement and treats them as it did in its third ##- ##qua ##rter trading statement , it will artificial ##ly in ##f ##late reported sales by 1 to 2 per cent . "
unused ##1 Te ##sco has rejected any suggestion of additional Club ##card v ##ou ##chers artificial ##ly in ##f ##lating sales , and Ms Neville ##- ##R ##ol ##fe says that if they make an unexpected difference to sales , Te ##sco will make this clear .
unused ##1 She adds that v ##ou ##chers make no difference to profit .
unused ##1 Te ##sco under pressure from talk of a cut in earnings guidance
unused ##1 Te ##sco hit a four ##- ##mont ##h low yesterday as analysts raised fears that the g ##ro ##cer would cut earnings guidance .
unused ##1 In ##ves ##tec Securities argued that management needed to re ##in in guidance so that it can keep UK profit margins stable .
unused ##1 With sales falling and customers moving online , Te ##sco ' ##s only option to defend margins is by raising prices , In ##ves ##tec said .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts expect Te ##sco ' ##s trading update due tomorrow to show that sales growth has stalled since Christmas , with same ##- ##sto ##re sales expected to be down by about 0 ##. ##5 per cent .
unused ##1 Heritage Oil was up 4 per cent to 147 ##. ##5 ##p after Goldman Sachs added the explorer to its " buy " list .
unused ##1 Fast ##jet , the African low ##- ##cos ##t airline , slumped 33 ##. ##5 per cent to 0 ##. ##8 ##p amid a profit warning .
unused ##1 Ad ##ded to divide ##nds , this would e ##qua ##te to returning about 60 per cent of its current market capital ##isation to shareholders , it said .
unused ##1 It forecast the US chain to remain loss ##making until at least 2016 .
unused ##1 The " prospect of a decisive shift in strategy towards cash generation " led U ##BS to add Te ##sco to its " buy " list with a 370 ##p price target .
unused ##1 Merrill Lynch down ##graded the explorer from " buy " to " under ##per ##form " , arguing that production from its Tu ##rk ##men ##istan projects was likely to fall short of management ' ##s own guidance .
unused ##1 Credit Su ##isse repeated its " out ##per ##form " stance on Shire ahead of third ##- ##qua ##rter results due next Thursday .
unused ##1 Equipment hire group Ash ##tead firm ##ed 3 ##. ##2 per cent to 35 ##6 ##. ##4 ##p after main US rival Ash ##tead beat forecast ##s with its third ##- ##qua ##rter earnings .
unused ##1 Te ##sco yesterday called on the Bank of England to cut interest rates in spite of Britain ' ##s biggest retailer appearing imp ##er ##vious to any difficulties facing the high street as it announced an improvement in sales .
unused ##1 However , some hint of a slow ##down was evident as Mr Higgins ##on said non ##- ##food sales were falling back a little as shop ##pers held back from buying more in ##du ##lge ##nt purchases beyond their weekly food shop .
unused ##1 Sign ##s of a down ##turn have yet to show in the headline figures , with underlying UK sales excluding petrol up 4 ##. ##1 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 24 - ahead of J Sai ##ns ##bury and W ##m Morrison ' ##s latest figures - and group sales up 11 ##. ##8 per cent .
unused ##1 UK sales overall were up 7 ##. ##6 per cent .
unused ##1 International sales across its 12 Asian and European businesses rose 26 per cent .
unused ##1 Almost a year after Te ##sco revealed a surprising Pound ##s 155 ##. ##6 ##m acquisition attempt , the supermarket group appeared to have its green fingers on the keys of Do ##bb ##ies , having fought Sir Tom , the retail and property entrepreneur , on the stock market and via the courts .
unused ##1 Sir Tom - who controls W ##yev ##ale , the UK ' ##s biggest garden centre chain - had accused Do ##bb ##ies ' board of " rolling over " for Te ##sco ' ##s initial bid last year and subsequently attempted to f ##rust ##rate the acquisition , resort ##ing to court last week in an unsuccessful bid to block an equity issue that could have di ##lut ##ed his holding .
unused ##1 After a difficult campaign , Te ##sco should now succeed in con ##sol ##ida ##ting its first non ##- ##food acquisition , which will continue to be run and developed separately under the Do ##bb ##ies brand name .
unused ##1 Te ##sco rallied to its best level since last year ' ##s profit warning yesterday as analysts backed the group to regain investors ' trust .
unused ##1 With h ##yper ##market ##s making up 92 per cent of Te ##sco ' ##s Korean floors ##pace , like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in the country may have dropped 8 per cent this year , it said .
unused ##1 The jump came after Bloomberg reported that V ##oda ##fo ##ne had been in merger talks with V ##eri ##zon Communications as recently as December , which had stalled over disagreements on leadership and corporate base .
unused ##1 Car ins ##urer Admiral bounced 5 ##. ##3 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##34 after its annual earnings and divide ##nd topped expectations .
unused ##1 A divide ##nd hike from Legal & General also beat forecast ##s , lifting its stock 2 per cent to 166 ##p .
unused ##1 Rest ##ric ##tions introduced eight years ago are designed to limit sales to a maximum of 100 tablets in a single transaction without a prescription .
unused ##1 Additional voluntary measures with retailers limit sales to two packs at a time .
unused ##1 Seven years after V ##oda ##fo ##ne last received a divide ##nd from V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the leading US mobile phone operator , the UK te ##le ##com ##s group will get a new pay ##- ##out in 2012 .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne , which has a 45 per cent stake in V ##eri ##zon Wireless , its joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications , will get a $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ) pay ##- ##out from the US mobile operator in January .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne will respond by paying a pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##b ##n special divide ##nd to its shareholders in February .
unused ##1 And why did V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nd payments stop in 2005 ?
unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon Communications , the US te ##le ##com ##s group which owns 55 per cent of V ##eri ##zon Wireless , has been hint ##ing since the middle of last year that the mobile operator would once again pay divide ##nds .
unused ##1 She estimated V ##eri ##zon Communications ' fixed ##- ##line phone business generated little or no cash , and therefore she argued it had become a necessity for the US group to obtain divide ##nds from V ##eri ##zon Wireless .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne never wanted V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds to stop in 2005 , but , as the minority shareholder , it had no say over the matter .
unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon Communications decided six years ago that the cash generated by V ##eri ##zon Wireless should be used to pay down its debt .
unused ##1 However , many analysts saw the halt to the mobile operator ' ##s divide ##nd payments as an attempt to squeeze V ##oda ##fo ##ne out of V ##eri ##zon Wireless .
unused ##1 Mr M ##c ##A ##dam and Mr Cola ##o are members of the V ##eri ##zon Wireless board , which at a meeting on Thursday agreed the $ ##10 ##b ##n divide ##nd payment .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts highlighted how the V ##eri ##zon Wireless board had only approved a one ##- ##off divide ##nd for 2012 , but V ##oda ##fo ##ne hopes the US mobile operator ' ##s cash distributions will become a recurring , annual event , because of V ##eri ##zon Communications ' need to maintain its own pay ##- ##out to shareholders .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne is returning 70 per cent of its $ ##4 ##. ##5 ##b ##n to shareholders via its special divide ##nd , and the remainder will be used to reduce the UK group ' ##s net debt .
unused ##1 If V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds do continue beyond 2012 , V ##oda ##fo ##ne could use some of the cash for acquisitions .
unused ##1 It is interested in buying rivals in some of its existing markets , including those in Europe and India .
unused ##1 Mr M ##c ##A ##dam and Mr Cola ##o have both recently played down the idea of a merger between V ##eri ##zon Communications and V ##oda ##fo ##ne .
unused ##1 But one investor who knows the two groups said a merger was possible in the medium to long term .
unused ##1 Ana ##ly ##sts at Morgan Stanley down ##graded their recommendation on V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s shares from " buy " to " sell " after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European mobile businesses by Pound ##s 900 ##m between 2009 and 2012 .
unused ##1 He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would cut V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation by 11 per cent , or Pound ##s 900 ##m .
unused ##1 That would e ##qua ##te to an 8 per cent cut in the group ' ##s e ##bit ##da .
unused ##1 Meanwhile , Tel ##ko ##m said it had rejected an offer by O ##ger Telecom that would have made the Middle East group its largest shareholder .
unused ##1 The Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch company ' ##s latest quarterly figures , due tomorrow , are expected to show a 3 ##. ##6 per cent rise in underlying sales , an improvement on the ##2 ##. ##9 per cent achieved in the first quarter .
unused ##1 Tate & Lyle was among the gain ##ers , up 1 per cent to 69 ##2 ##p , as AB ##N Am ##ro said a trade deal on sweet ##ener ##s between Mexico and the US was positive for the sugar group , and up ##ped its target price from 71 ##0 ##p to 77 ##5 ##p .
unused ##1 Ka ##zak ##hm ##ys was protected from the worst of the falls in the mining sector , ending down 0 ##. ##2 per cent at Pound ##s 12 ##. ##4 ##9 , as a sharp jump in production prompted Credit Su ##isse to raise its price target from Pound ##s 13 to Pound ##s 15 .
unused ##1 The shares closed 3 per cent lower at 31 ##8 ##. ##2 ##p , its sharp ##est fall since a January profit warning .
unused ##1 Half ##ord ##s jumped 14 ##. ##1 per cent to 303 ##. ##5 ##p after reporting its best like ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##like sales in more than three years .
unused ##1 The retailer reported improved sales in all categories .
unused ##1 Seymour Pierce added the stock to its " buy " list following an analyst visit .
unused ##1 C ##ur ##ren ##cy printer De La Rue took on 1 ##. ##9 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##10 ##. ##43 on the back of an upgrade from JP ##M ##or ##gan .
unused ##1 " Our financial performance fell short of where we wanted it to be , " said Stuart Chambers , chairman of Te ##sco ' ##s re ##mu ##ner ##ation committee , after pre ##- ##ta ##x profit ha ##lved following a series of one ##- ##off charges .
unused ##1 A ##gg ##rek ##o , the generator hire group , was up 4 ##. ##1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##. ##13 as Credit Su ##isse started coverage with a pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##. ##40 target price .
unused ##1 " Our bear case scenario is in line with current consensus while our bull case suggests that 2012 consensus could be 45 per cent too low , " said the broker , though with shares having doubled inside 12 months it applied a " neutral " rating .
unused ##1 J Sai ##ns ##bury gained 1 ##. ##7 per cent to 385 1 ##/ ##2 p after U ##BS added the supermarket to its " buy " list based on expansion potential and non ##- ##food growth lifting profit margins .
unused ##1 U ##BS set a 450 ##p target price on the stock .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver , the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch consumer goods group , is beef ##ing up its Russian portfolio with the acquisition of Con ##cer ##n Kali ##na in a deal that values the beauty company ' ##s equity at EU ##R ##500 ##m .
unused ##1 Late last year P ##ep ##si ##C ##o unveiled a $ ##5 ##. ##4 ##b ##n bet on the Russian food and drinks market through the acquisition of W ##im ##m ##- ##B ##ill ##- ##D ##ann , the dairy and fruit juice company .
unused ##1 At the same time Dan ##one of France acquired Russia ' ##s Un ##im ##il ##k .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver itself acquired In ##mark ##o ice cream company in 2008 .
unused ##1 Con ##cer ##n Kali ##na , Russia ' ##s biggest local personal care company by sales , is expected to generate sales of EU ##R ##30 ##3 ##m this year .
unused ##1 The 9 per cent earnings growth reported by Pro ##cter & G ##amble on Monday has set the context for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s second ##- ##qua ##rter results tomorrow .
unused ##1 Even so , although the range of analysts ' forecast ##s is wide , some are expecting no more than 1 ##. ##5 per cent underlying sales growth , which would represent a slow ##down in momentum compared with the first quarter .
unused ##1 Pro ##cter & G ##amble ' ##s takeover of Gill ##ette increases pressure on Un ##ile ##ver , under fire for slow growth and missed forecast ##s .
unused ##1 L ##' ##O ##real of France has been selling more skin ##care cream ##s and co ##sm ##etics across the globe , helping it report a 5 ##. ##5 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar increase in sales in the first quarter .
unused ##1 In China , one of the few emerging markets where P ##& ##G boasts a longer history than Un ##ile ##ver , L ##' ##O ##real lifted sales by 11 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in its first quarter .
unused ##1 Sad ##ly , yesterday ' ##s 2 per cent increase in turnover and 0 ##. ##2 per cent decline in operating margin was not satisfactory .
unused ##1 One quarter is too soon to declare this recovery stalled , but the continued slide in European sales ( still more than a third of Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s business ) is an alarm ##ing sign of how much more he has to do .
unused ##1 But on Monday it agreed to spend $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n on Alberto C ##ul ##ver , which mostly sells its s ##ham ##po ##o and cream ##s in the US and the UK - s ##lug ##gis ##h markets at best .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s personal care sector is also growing fast : sales rose 16 per cent in the first half of this year , about twice as fast as ice cream and home care .
unused ##1 Ad ##d those to Alberto C ##ul ##ver ' ##s expected $ ##26 ##0 ##m operating profit next year , take off tax , and earnings should rise by about $ ##29 ##0 ##m .
unused ##1 In other words , the acquisition will deliver an initial return of about 8 per cent , more or less in line with estimates for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s post ##- ##ac ##quisition weighted average cost of capital .
unused ##1 Yesterday Un ##ile ##ver , which already owns just over half of H ##U ##L , offered Rs ##60 ##0 to buy up to another 23 per cent of it .
unused ##1 So a EU ##R ##19 ##m gain versus Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s forecast earnings of EU ##R ##5 ##b ##n .
unused ##1 Other good news included a 5 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar increase in fourth ##- ##qua ##rter like ##- for ##- ##like group sales .
unused ##1 Yet the share price has risen 19 per cent since the start of 2005 , even as consensus forecast ##s for 2006 earnings have fallen by 7 per cent .
unused ##1 The Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch company ' ##s impressive 7 ##. ##6 per cent first ##- ##qua ##rter volume growth beat both US arch ##- ##ri ##val ##s that also reported on Thursday - Pro ##cter & G ##amble ( 7 per cent ) and Col ##gate ##- ##P ##al ##mo ##li ##ve ( 6 per cent ) .
unused ##1 St ##rik ##ingly , however , Un ##ile ##ver increased its operating margin by 60 basis points ( P ##& ##G ' ##s was up by 80 ##b ##ps ) , while delivering a he ##fty increase in advertising and promotional spending - worth 220 ##b ##p of sales .
unused ##1 Meanwhile , the she ##en dim ##med a little this week on domestic rival Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser , whose first ##- ##qua ##rter figures failed , un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally , to meet expectations .
unused ##1 Pre ##- ##ta ##x profits rose 16 per cent in the first half of 2006 ,
