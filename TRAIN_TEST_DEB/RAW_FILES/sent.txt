Shares in Barclays , the UK 's second-largest bank by market capitalisation , fell 5 per cent yesterday in spite of healthy profits for the third quarter , an improved assessment of the outlook for loan losses and the reinstatement of its dividend after almost a year .
Analysts said the decline was a reaction to the one-third quarter-on-quarter fall in investment banking revenue to pound(s)3.7bn , although the Barclays Capital business , which was beefed up through the acquisition of the US operations of Lehman Brothers , contributed a third of group profits .

unused1 The bank said first-half headline pre-tax profits fell 71 per cent to pound(s)759m .
unused1 The steep fall in Barclays ' statutory pre-tax profit was mainly attributable to a pound(s)2.95bn " own credit " accounting loss on the fluctuating value of its issued debt .
unused1 However , on an underlying basis that excludes the " own credit " accounting distortion and other items , first-half pre-tax profit rose 13 per cent to pound(s)4.23bn , ahead of analysts ' average forecast of pound(s)3.82bn.
unused1 Dividends will be held in respect of this financial year , so shareholders should receive a 1p per share interim dividend in September , another 1p in early December and a 3.5p final dividend next March .

Consider BarCap 's performance in fixed income , currencies and commodities , where revenue rose 9 per cent to pound(s)2.4bn from a year ago .
That suggests BarCap is maintaining , even increasing , its share .
unused1 Or take the unit 's equities revenue , up just 1 per cent .
Yet that makes BarCap and Morgan Stanley the only investment banks to report an increase so far .
unused1 Overall , revenue at the UK lender 's wholesale bank climbed 3 per cent , compared with Deutsche 's 11 per cent decline , itself in line with JPMorgan Chase 's comparable revenue drop .
Deutsche 's FICC machine , meanwhile , generated income of EUR3.4bn , 8 per cent lower than a year ago but still trumping its UK rival by EUR500m .
That may be less than the one-fifth FICC decline at Credit Suisse , but US peers ' equivalent revenues rose 5 per cent .
unused1 It was a different story in equities , however : the German investment bank 's revenue slid 23 per cent , although at EUR726m it was still higher than Barclays ' number .

Barclays ' first-quarter profit surged by almost 47 per cent , yet its shares slid by more than 6 per cent yesterday .
In part , the strong fixed income , currencies and commodities ( FICC ) performances from Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank had stoked expectations that Barclays Capital would also shoot the lights out .
But instead , BarCap 's revenue was down 26 per cent on last year , and top-line income from FICC was almost 40 per cent lower , compared with the roughly 10 per cent fall at other investment banks .
Credit Suisse 's recent first-quarter results disappointed for much the same reason .
Although Barclays ' pre-tax profits rose by 47 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , helped by a sharp fall in impairments , BarCap accounted for more than four-fifths of them .
Given that the market conditions of the first two quarters of last year are unlikely to be repeated , another way to see BarCap 's revenue decline is as setting a more normal quarterly run-rate of pound(s)3.5bn-pound(s)4bn , Credit Suisse notes .
For a bank that has had a tricky year in its core UK retail business , Barclays ' 15 per cent jump in full year pre-tax profits looks impressive .
This does not mean that all in the domestic garden is rosy : performance was shored up by strong earnings growth at Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm , and BGI , the global fund management business .

HSBC delivers 25 % rise in profits

Jury still out on Unilever 's first-quarter sales recovery
Unilever bucked its recent depressing trend with a surprise increase in underlying sales growth during the first quarter .
Analysts and investors had been wary of poor first-quarter results from Unilever , which has struggled with declining sales in recent years .
But Unilever said its competitive position had improved over the past six months , with sales growing 2 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier , excluding the impact of extra trading days .
unused1 Most of the increase was down to healthy sales of Unilever products in emerging markets . 
unused1 In Asia and Africa , the company 's underlying sales rose by some 7 per cent .
unused1 Europe remained weak even as the company cut prices to try and improve its competitive position , and sales dropped 2 per cent . 
unused1 Sales rose 4 per cent in the Americas .
unused1 Pre-tax profit was up 8.5 per cent to Euros 1.28bn ( Pounds 867m ) .
unused1 Analysts said it is too early to tell whether the first-quarter rise in underlying sales growth would be sustained .
unused1 Relatively low investment in A&P may be boosting Unilever 's profit margins , one analyst said . 
Unilever 's overall turnover fell 6 per cent in 2004 compared with the year before , while net profit fell 32 per cent and underlying sales rose just 0.4 per cent .
In May , Vodafone announced a 1.3 per cent rise in revenues to £ 46.4bn for the 12 months to March 31 , while pre-tax profit was flat at £ 9.5bn , with a £ 4bn impairment charge for poor performance in rapidly weakening European markets .
Between July 2008 , when Mr Colao became chief executive , and March 2012 , Vodafone delivered total shareholder return of 45.8 per cent , a £ 14.9bn appreciation in market capitalisation , with £ 19.2bn paid out in dividends and £ 6.7bn in share buybacks .
unused1 The drop in spending by cash-strapped consumers in southern Europe and tougher government regulation prompted the company to cut its medium-term revenue growth target by 1 percentage point to a range of 0-3 per cent .
The story was different in the US where Verizon Wireless , the mobile operator 45 per cent owned by Vodafone , reported service revenues up 7.3 per cent year on year , contributing £ 4.9bn of profit to the British group .
In the 12 months to March 31 , Vodafone reported flat pre-tax profit of £ 9.5bn from revenues up from £ 45.8bn to £ 46.4bn .
unused1 Diluted earnings per share fell from 15.11p to 13.65p , and a final dividend of 6.47p was proposed , up from 6.05p , bringing the total payout to shareholders for the year - including a 4p special dividend - to 13.52p , a rise of 51.9 per cent from the previous year .
Mr Colao refused to comment on Vodafone 's £ 1.04bn bid for Cable & Wireless Worldwide , which has been called into doubt due to shareholder resistance to the deal .
Mr Colao also took a swipe at the Indian authorities for pursuing Vodafone for $ 2.6bn in capital gains tax following its acquisition of a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar , an Indian mobile business , in 2007 .
Vodafone 's board will today ratify an extension of the mobile operator 's aggressive share buy-back programme after repurchasing Pounds 564.7m of stock in the past eight weeks .

Today 's board meeting will also reaffirm plans for a more generous dividend pay-out as Vodafone prepares to announce underlying earnings up 2.3 per cent at Pounds 12.9bn on sales of Pounds 34bn , compared with Pounds 33.6bn last time .
unused1 Analysts at Lehman Brothers are expecting the company to report about 1.5m 3G subscribers at the end of March . 
This could raise doubts about Vodafone 's target of reaching 10m subscribers by the end of the current financial year .

In spite of these problems , there , Vodafone 's pre-tax profits are expected to rise modestly from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 10.2bn with the total number of subscribers likely to rise about 10 per cent this year from the 151.8m total at the end of last year .

Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator 45 per cent owned by Vodafone , reported service revenues up 7.3 per cent year on year and contributed £ 4.9bn to the group 's bottom line .

Tensions rise at Tesco as chain is set for worst Christmas sales for decades
Tesco is forecast to deliver its worst Christmas sales performance in the UK for decades , amid reports of tensions at the top of Britain 's biggest retailer over its unsuccessful pricecutting campaign .
JPMorgan Cazenove , joint broker to Tesco , is forecasting a 1.5 per cent decline in UK sales from stores open at least a year , in the six weeks to January 7 , representing a sharp deterioration from the previous reported trading period .
Tesco said when it announced the first wave of price cuts in September that UK profit would be broadly flat in the second half of its financial year .
unused1 The central European businesses , bar Poland , suffered falls in profits during the recession .
unused1 " I am pleased we have been able to improve relative performance , we have got back in the lead , " he said , as UK sales rose 4.2 per cent to pound(s)42bn for the year ending February 27 .
unused1 Reporting group sales up 6 per cent to pound(s)57bn over the year , with pre-tax profits up 9 per cent at pound(s)3.2bn , Sir Terry said Asia was a " major engine of growth of the group " .
unused1 He predicted Tesco would dip into a loss of about pound(s)25m in China after a broadly break-even performance .

unused1 In Central Europe , sales fell 0.7 per cent to pound(s)10bn , with trading profit off 4 per cent to pound(s)474m .
unused1 In the US the losses ran to pound(s)165m for the year .

unused1 International sales grew 22 per cent in the first half year on year and accounted for just one-quarter of Pounds 25bn total group sales .
Tesco 's recovery path to start with sales dip
Tesco 's UK underlying sales are set to fall in the first quarter , despite chief executive Philip Clarke 's recovery plan for the retailer 's domestic business .
unused1 In April , Mr Clarke set out a strategic blueprint for Britain 's biggest supermarket chain by market share after its first profit warning in 20 years .
However , City analysts still forecast a decline in sales from Tesco UK stores open at least a year when the retailer reports on June 11 .
unused1 Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , expects a decline in UK like-for-like sales of 1-2 per cent year on year , excluding fuel and VAT , in the retailer 's first quarter .
unused1 With inflation of about 2.5 per cent , the volume of goods sold would be down 3-4 per cent .
unused1 Andrew Kasoulis , analyst at Credit Suisse , forecasts a 1.5 per cent decline .
This compares with a 1.6 per cent drop in UK like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter to the end of February , although it is an improvement on the 2.3 per cent decline over Christmas and the new year , Tesco 's worst performance for decades .
Mr Black said the first-quarter performance would be in line with expectations , as Tesco was just starting to implement the changes Mr Clarke talked about in April , such as putting more staff into supermarkets and introducing improved ready meals .
unused1 " We would not be expecting Tesco to be doing anything other than performing in line with the fourth quarter , slightly underperforming the industry .
unused1 " While we think there probably has been some underlying sales improvement , aided by the very high level of money-off coupons , we think April was weak [ impacted by the weather ] and the calendar will not unwind until the second quarter , " said Mr Kasoulis in a note .
unused1 Analysts expect group sales to rise 9 per cent to pound(s)59bn , and pre-tax profit to rise more than 6 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn.
unused1 Bernstein Research has pencilled in operating profits of pound(s)263m , or 10 per cent of the UK operating profit , for the year to March .
Results in Tesco 's international business - Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities expects revenues to be 13.4 per cent higher at pound(s)18.3bn - will be mixed , with continental Europe hard hit .
unused1 Shore Capital expects profits there , given the struggles of economies such as the Irish Republic and Hungary , to be down 10 per cent .
Analysts are also pencilling in more losses at Fresh & Easy , Tesco 's US convenience chain , although Clive Black of Shore Capital thinks the chain might have reached its nadir .
Nine months into a plan to overhaul the UK business and one year after its profit warning , Tesco 's Christmas sales figures look relatively underwhelming .
unused1 In the six weeks to January 5 , group like-for-like sales excluding petrol were up 0.3 per cent .
unused1 UK like-for-like sales , excluding petrol and stripping out sales from Clubcard vouchers , were broadly in line with expectations , rising 1.4 per cent , boosted by better food and online sales .
But broker Seymour Pierce points out that this is a poor return considering Tesco has invested 1 per cent of its tight margin this financial year to achieve it , following a profit warning a year ago after the group 's dire performance at Christmas 2011 .
Like-for-like sales in Asia and central Europe continued to decline , while in the US , where Tesco is reviewing its Fresh & Easy business , like-for-like sales fell 2.1 per cent .
As its 10 per cent increase in first half profits yesterday showed , Tesco is about as safe as things come in these uncertain , paranoid times .
unused1 UK underlying sales growth of 3.7 per cent lags behind more price-orientated competitors such as Morrisons and Wal-Mart 's Asda , even if the threat from " deep " discounters such as Aldi is exaggerated .
Tesco 's 4 per cent higher non-food sales came from a significant , unspecified , space rise- meaning sales densities fell .
unused1 Internationally , sales growth of 1 per cent from stores open at least a year is underwhelming , given the amount of space added .
unused1 Underlying sales were flat last year and profit margins declined slightly .
Success overseas is patchy ( the US business is still bleeding cash ; the Chinese one has not broken even as quickly as Tesco expected ) but overall trading profit rose 11 per cent in Europe and 30 per cent in Asia .
Tesco 's net debt is not that large , but capital expenditure is high .
unused1 The dividend payout works out at only about a third of that but , as promised last year , the 11 per cent increase in the interim dividend is in line with earnings growth , boosted by profits from property sales .
These reached Pounds 74m in the first half and are expected to continue apace , as Tesco reduces the amount of property it owns from 85 per cent to about 70 per cent of its portfolio .
unused1 The group 's share buy-back programme is now running , though the Pounds 1.5bn targeted over the next five years is insignificant in the context of the company 's near Pounds 30bn capitalisation .
unused1 Still , a dividend yield approaching 2.8 per cent this year seems acceptable for a company investing heavily in growth opportunities .
unused1 In the UK , like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter of 6.6 per cent year-on-year looks roughly in line , rather than ahead of competitors .
unused1 Yesterday 's first-half results were atrocious , with profits for the UK company down in almost all areas of the business .
unused1 The rate of decline in UK like-for-like sales slowed in the second quarter against the first - from 1.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent - as a turnround plan that involves back-to-basics wisdom such as low prices , more welcoming stores and higher staffing took effect .
unused1 That is a decent start but it can not yet be counted as evidence that January 's profit warning was a blip rather than the start of a long , Carrefour-style decline .
On 10 times forecast earnings , Tesco is at a discount to the likes of Sainsbury ( 12 ) and Walmart ( 14 ) .
But Tesco is no longer the growth story it once was and bargain hunters should hold off until there is more evidence of a recovery than one quarter of improvement in like-for-like sales numbers .
unused1 The UK business , its main earnings engine , increased trading profit by 5 per cent to pound(s)1.3bn on sales 6 per cent higher .
unused1 Strip out the effect of new stores , however , and sales excluding petrol and value added tax fell by 0.5 per cent , mostly in the second quarter .
The outlook is gloomier : Tesco predicts flat profit in the second half from a year ago .
Tesco 's Asian and European operations , where first-half trading profit rose 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively , should continue to ease the pain .
unused1 Group trading profit , which rose by 3.7 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , would have been 4.5 percentage points higher without a pound(s)57m one-off provision for personal protection insurance mis-selling claims .
Tesco has little to show for the pound(s)1bn it has spent in the US , other than pound(s)800m of accumulated losses and a 200-store estate that struggled to attract shoppers .
unused1 With the core UK business struggling ( like-for-like sales in the UK fell 1.2 per cent in the third quarter ) , the company is becoming increasingly frugal and picking its targets far more carefully .
Tesco 's lacklustre UK sales growth is concerning when competitors J Sainsbury ( expected to report buoyant figures today ) and Wm Morrison have accelerated like-for-like growth through the recession .
Deep discounters ' market share gains have ground to a halt , and with the anniversary of discount brands ' launch now passed , Tesco says its UK like-for-like sales growth has " converged with the industry " .
Profit growth was also tempered by higher interest costs after Tesco acquired Korea 's Homever chain for pound(s)958m and bought out Royal Bank of Scotland 's 50 per cent share in their financial services joint venture for pound(s)950m last year .
International sales - now one-third of Tesco 's total - should accelerate as markets in central Europe and Asia pull out of the doldrums .
unused1 Food & DRUG Retailers ; Group says it is catching UK rivals ; International sales buoy first quarter
Tesco insisted it was narrowing the gap on faster-growing UK rivals Wm Morrison , J Sainsbury and Asda , as international sales buoyed its first-quarter performance .
The comments come ahead of first-quarter figures today from Sainsbury , which are expected to reveal a 6.4 per cent increase in like-for-like sales .
unused1 Demand for non-food items was also picking up , with " modest " like-for-like sales growth resuming in recent weeks .
unused1 Group sales for the 13 weeks to May 30 rose 9.7 per cent including petrol , and 12.6 per cent excluding such sales .
International sales rose 20.1 per cent , or 11.4 per cent at constant exchange rates , boosted by Asian markets , but held back by Ireland where Tesco has been trying to stem the flow of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains in Northern Ireland .
Sales in the US - where Tesco has been forced to slow its expansion plans - almost tripled , although Mr McIlwee acknowledged that the US operation was an " immature and small business " .
Tesco 's personal finance operation contributed 2.2 percentage points to overall UK sales growth of 9.3 per cent .
unused1 " The customer count is increasing steadily , " said Mr McIlwee .
Second , price-led formats are thriving - Aldi , the German-owned discounter , says total UK sales rose 22 per cent in December .
unused1 The step-up in its Christmas sales from the previous quarter suggests the initiative is paying off - and could start denting the currently superior performance of rival supermarket groups Sainsbury , Wm Morrison , and Wal-Mart 's Asda .
Tesco led the wider market lower after reporting weaker than expected non-food sales over Christmas .
Dixons Retail also blamed the pre-Christmas snow for a profit warning , sending its shares down 10 per cent to 21 1/4 p.
But Argos owner Home Retail Group bounced 10.2 per cent to 227p amid short covering after its holiday sales proved better than feared .
Car insurer Admiral Group took on 2.9 per cent to pound(s)15.69 , helped by " buy " advice from Redburn Partners .
unused1 So much for record Pounds 2bn profit , gangbuster sales growth and a market share above 30 per cent .
However , most analysts expect underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 per cent , which would be up to Pounds 900m more than Tesco officially budgeted for .
unused1 Some already have their eye on Pounds 3bn in profit in coming years .
Boots , which last week reported a 11.4 per cent decline in profit before exceptionals to Pounds 481m , is one of the many retailers that has been hit by the march of supermarkets into the health and beauty market .

Schroders recorded its biggest fall in four years , sliding 9.5 per cent to 872p after the banking group unveiled an unexpected drop in funds under management in the second quarter .
unused1 Teather & Greenwood cut its recommendation on the stock from " buy " to " hold " , saying it was concerned over the level of UK institutional outflows at the fund management group - a " thorn in the company 's side " , according to the broker .
On the upside , steelmaker Corus advanced 1.6 per cent to 388 1/ 4p as record third quarter numbers from European peer Thyssenkrupp encouraged buyers .
Biofuels rallied 6 per cent to 96p as Collins Stewart , house broker , reminded investors that the biodiesel producer was now cash generative and repeated its 135p price target .
According to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel , the consumer research group , Tesco experienced stronger than expected sales growth over the past four weeks .
unused1 In the four weeks to November 25 , sales through Tesco 's tills rose 2.7 per cent year on year , ahead of the market at 2.5 per cent , and making it the fastest growing of the so-called big four supermarkets .
Tesco 's grocery sales rose 5.2 per cent in the four weeks to November 25 , according to Kantar , compared with the market at 3.1 per cent , indicating that the retailer 's performance is being dragged down by sales of non-food items .
unused1 The brighter picture comes ahead of today 's third-quarter update , when it is forecast to report flat to slightly negative sales growth for the three months to the end of November .
This is a slowdown from the second quarter , when Tesco had its first rise in UK like-for-like sales for two years , up 0.1 per cent in the three months to the end of August .
Analysts at Deutsche Bank , joint broker to Tesco , forecast a 0.8 per cent decline in Tesco 's UK like-for-like sales in the third quarter , driven mostly by weakness in non-food , while Shore Capital forecasts flat sales to a 1 per cent decline .
unused1 However , Dave McCarthy , analyst at Investec Securities , said it was possible Tesco 's sales could be better than forecast , as recent trading will have been " flattered by the timing and nature of promotions " .
Tesco is also facing headwinds from overseas , with like-for-like sales in its lossmaking US business forecast to rise by 4-5 per cent , according to Shore Capital .
unused1 This would be only marginally ahead of the 3.6 per cent increase in the first quarter , regarded as disappointing by the market .
While Tesco experienced better trading in the past four weeks , sales growth slowed at J Sainsbury , from 5.3 per cent in October to 1.4 per cent in November .
Sainsbury 's grocery sales rose by 1 per cent .
Wm Morrison sales fell 1.7 per cent in November , according to Kantar .
In a year peppered with job losses , profit warnings and missed targets , Tesco managed to buck the wider malaise in the retailing sector and provided the high point of 2005 when it became the first UK retailer to break the Pounds 2bn profit barrier .

Richard Baker from Boots came under pressure after dishing out two rapid profit warnings on the back of worsening trading .
But that turned out to be a smokescreen for a far bigger deal : the proposed Pounds 7bn merger between Boots and Alliance UniChem .
JPMorgan said the acquistion gave Tesco a chance to close the gap on Shinsegae 's E-mart , which has sales of Won9,000bn ( Pounds ? ? bn ) , against Tesco 's Won5,900bn .
Tesco chief cautious despite store 's pound(s)3.1bn record profit
In the midst of the worst recession of a generation , Sir Terry Leahy proved his calibre once again yesterday as he overcame the obvious obstacles to deliver yet another year of record profits and growth at Tesco .
unused1 Against the backdrop of a global downturn , trading profit rose 8.8 per cent year-on-year to pound(s)3.1bn ( $4.5bn ) .
As consumers across many of Tesco 's 14 markets tighten their belts , it lifted group sales by 13.5 per cent to pound(s)60bn .
Even in the UK , where Tesco 's underlying sales growth of 3 per cent for the year is clearly lagging rivals Wm Morrison and Asda , Sir Terry still turned in a best-in-class trading margin of 6.2 per cent , helped by some crafty cost-cutting ( to the tune of pound(s)540m in the past financial year ) .
unused1 First , the retailer 's net debt has ballooned to pound(s)9.6bn from pound(s)6.2bn in the past year .
Instead of breaking even this year , Tesco is now looking at another year of losses .

Philip Clarke , chief executive of Tesco , claimed an early victory in his pound(s)1bn battle to turn round Tesco 's UK business after a profit warning a year ago , as he confirmed a reshuffle of his top team .
unused1 The retailer said UK sales rose 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the six weeks to January 5 , on a " like-for-like " basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and the VAT sales tax .
The Christmas trading figures were much better than Tesco 's dire performance over the same six-week period a year earlier , when it posted a like-for-like sales decline of 2.3 per cent in the UK .

unused1 Mr Clarke , who also reported Tesco 's first increase in under-lying UK sales for almost two years , said Fresh & Easy needed to " persuade " him it had a future with the group .
He said Fresh & Easy had " stumbled " in the first half , disappointing with losses of pound(s)74m , broadly the same as last year .
Mr Clarke 's comments came as a pound(s)1bn investment to turn round Tesco 's UK business , plus a decline in international earnings , cut group pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to pound(s)1.66bn in the six months to August 25 , the first fall for 18 years .

unused1 Total sales across the group rose 8.8 per cent , excluding fuel .
unused1 The supermarket group has suffered several downgrades to profit forecasts as a result of restrictions imposed on big retailers ' store opening hours in South Korea , which are expected to hit its sales and profits .

unused1 JPMorgan Cazenove and Nomura , both brokers to Tesco , have each cut their forecasts of Tesco 's pre-tax profit this year , excluding property profits , by 2 per cent to about pound(s)3.5bn - reflecting a pound(s)70m reduction in profits from Korea .

" We believe ITV 's current share price has already factored in the worse-thanexpected second quarter , " said JPMorgan Cazenove .

unused1 At a group level , sales and profits in the six months to the end of August were all heading in the right direction , driven by a recovery in many of Tesco 's international markets in central Europe and in Asia .
unused1 Indeed , Sir Terry was able to reveal a 12.5 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profit to pound(s)1.6bn , on sales excluding VAT up 7.1 per cent to pound(s)29.8bn , as economies recovered in Asia and Europe .

unused1 But Mr Clarke has at least attempted to confine this to a range : mid single-digit trading profit growth delivering a return of 12 to 15 per cent on capital , which will be invested at a rate of 3.5 to 4 per cent of sales .
Tesco poised to make profits history
Tesco is expected to make corporate history on Tuesday by being the first UK retailer to announce profits in excess of pound(s)3bn , but celebrations are likely to be short-lived , writes Samantha Pearson .
unused1 While the group remains Britain 's biggest supermarket chain , it has been gradually losing market share in the downturn as its rivals lure customers with recession-friendly discounts .
Investors will therefore be awaiting evidence in the full-year results that Tesco 's attempts to adapt its offering through monitoring customer spending have helped to maintain UK sales growth .
The other talking point will be Tesco 's net debt , which although still manageable is likely to exceed the group 's previous target of pound(s)8bn and could stunt short-term store growth .
unused1 Tesco , however , is likely to reassure long-term investors with promising performance from its recent acquisition in South Korea and words of encouragement on its new initiative to introduce 30 in-store banks this year .

Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , is forecasting losses from Fresh & Easy of about pound(s)80m ( $127.4m ) in the six months to August 22 .

unused1 Moody 's said it had cut Tesco 's long-term senior unsecured rating by one notch from A3 to Baa1 because the pound(s)1bn plan would weigh on earnings .
" It will take time for Tesco to reap the benefits of the measures it has announced in order to revive profit growth in its key UK market to levels seen in previous years , especially in the current unfavourable environment which will not support Tesco 's sales growth , " said Yasmina Serghini-Douvin , senior analyst at Moody's .

unused1 The move comes after Philip Clarke , chief executive , blamed a ferocious fightback from rival supermarkets for the 2.3 per cent decline in Tesco 's UK sales from stores open at least a year , as its big competitors bombarded customers with vouchers and coupons .
unused1 " There was a lot of promotional couponing going on around Christmas , " Mr Clarke said when the profit warning was announced last Thursday .
unused1 Last month the retailer showed it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as it reported the first slowdown in underlying sales growth for two years .
unused1 Overall sales in the UK rose 11.6 per cent in the third quarter .
unused1 Growth in non-food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double-digits .
However , the market , which has become used to Tesco significantly outperforming its rivals , gave a lukewarm response to the figures , which showed under-lying sales up 5.7 per cent in the seven weeks to January 7 with volumes up 7.2 per cent .

unused1 She adds that vouchers make no difference to profit .

Almost a year after Tesco revealed a surprising Pounds 155.6m acquisition attempt , the supermarket group appeared to have its green fingers on the keys of Dobbies , having fought Sir Tom , the retail and property entrepreneur , on the stock market and via the courts .
Sir Tom - who controls Wyevale , the UK 's biggest garden centre chain - had accused Dobbies ' board of " rolling over " for Tesco 's initial bid last year and subsequently attempted to frustrate the acquisition , resorting to court last week in an unsuccessful bid to block an equity issue that could have diluted his holding .
After a difficult campaign , Tesco should now succeed in consolidating its first non-food acquisition , which will continue to be run and developed separately under the Dobbies brand name .

Vodafone , which has a 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless , its joint venture with Verizon Communications , will get a $4.5bn ( pound(s)2.7bn ) pay-out from the US mobile operator in January .
Vodafone will respond by paying a pound(s)2bn special dividend to its shareholders in February .
And why did Verizon Wireless ' dividend payments stop in 2005 ?
Verizon Communications , the US telecoms group which owns 55 per cent of Verizon Wireless , has been hinting since the middle of last year that the mobile operator would once again pay dividends .
She estimated Verizon Communications ' fixed-line phone business generated little or no cash , and therefore she argued it had become a necessity for the US group to obtain dividends from Verizon Wireless .
Vodafone never wanted Verizon Wireless ' dividends to stop in 2005 , but , as the minority shareholder , it had no say over the matter .
Verizon Communications decided six years ago that the cash generated by Verizon Wireless should be used to pay down its debt .
However , many analysts saw the halt to the mobile operator 's dividend payments as an attempt to squeeze Vodafone out of Verizon Wireless .
Mr McAdam and Mr Colao are members of the Verizon Wireless board , which at a meeting on Thursday agreed the $10bn dividend payment .
Analysts highlighted how the Verizon Wireless board had only approved a one-off dividend for 2012 , but Vodafone hopes the US mobile operator 's cash distributions will become a recurring , annual event , because of Verizon Communications ' need to maintain its own pay-out to shareholders .
Vodafone is returning 70 per cent of its $4.5bn to shareholders via its special dividend , and the remainder will be used to reduce the UK group 's net debt .
If Verizon Wireless ' dividends do continue beyond 2012 , Vodafone could use some of the cash for acquisitions .
unused1 It is interested in buying rivals in some of its existing markets , including those in Europe and India .
Mr McAdam and Mr Colao have both recently played down the idea of a merger between Verizon Communications and Vodafone .
unused1 But one investor who knows the two groups said a merger was possible in the medium to long term .
unused1 Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded their recommendation on Vodafone 's shares from " buy " to " sell " after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at Vodafone 's European mobile businesses by Pounds 900m between 2009 and 2012 .
unused1 He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would cut Vodafone 's European earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation by 11 per cent , or Pounds 900m .
unused1 That would equate to an 8 per cent cut in the group 's ebitda .
Meanwhile , Telkom said it had rejected an offer by Oger Telecom that would have made the Middle East group its largest shareholder .

unused1 Sadly , yesterday 's 2 per cent increase in turnover and 0.2 per cent decline in operating margin was not satisfactory .
One quarter is too soon to declare this recovery stalled , but the continued slide in European sales ( still more than a third of Unilever 's business ) is an alarming sign of how much more he has to do .
unused1 But on Monday it agreed to spend $3.7bn on Alberto Culver , which mostly sells its shampoo and creams in the US and the UK - sluggish markets at best .
Unilever 's personal care sector is also growing fast : sales rose 16 per cent in the first half of this year , about twice as fast as ice cream and home care .
unused1 Add those to Alberto Culver 's expected $260m operating profit next year , take off tax , and earnings should rise by about $290m .
unused1 In other words , the acquisition will deliver an initial return of about 8 per cent , more or less in line with estimates for Unilever 's post-acquisition weighted average cost of capital .
Yesterday Unilever , which already owns just over half of HUL , offered Rs600 to buy up to another 23 per cent of it .

Unilever took a Euros 353m ( Pounds 244m ) write-down in Slim-Fast after sales of its products fell 25 per cent in the first half .

That is roughly in line with similar deals carried out by multinationals , most recently drugmaker GlaxoSmith-Kline which late last year lifted its 43.2 per cent stake in its pivotal Indian division , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare , to 75 per cent .
The news came a day after HUL , India 's largest consumer goods company , announced a better-than- expected 15 per cent rise in first quarter net profit .

Unilever looks to clean up in Alberto Culver buy
Unilever 's swoop on Alberto Culver was predominantly greeted with enthusiasm by analysts and investors , with most seeing it as a shrewd move into the fastest-growing sector of the consumer goods industry .
Assuming earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation for 2010 of $259m ( pound(s)163m ) and the small amount of cash held by Alberto Culver , the $3.7bn price tag will mean an enterprise value to ebitda multiple of 14 times .

Unilever reports 5.5 % sales rise
Unilever 's success in marketing anti-dandruff shampoo to the Russians and Chinese and slimming teas to the French helped the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate report strong full-year sales growth of 5.5 per cent yesterday , underlining its transformation into a more robust company .
unused1 Margins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13.7 per cent .
unused1 Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposals since 2000 have carved out Euros 8bn worth of revenues .
unused1 In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain sluggish .
So while Unilever expects to hit the top end of its 3-5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still lags behind peers .

Vodafone 's shares closed up 6.2 per cent at 115p after the world 's largest mobile phone operator by revenue confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound(s)11bn to pound(s)11.5bn for 2008-09 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements .
Vodafone 's revenue rose 17.1 per cent to pound(s)19.9bn in the six months to September 30 .
unused1 Ad-justed operating profit rose 10.5 per cent to pound(s)5.8bn , fuelled by sterling 's weakness against the euro and the dollar .
unused1 On an underlying basis , operating profit fell 1 per cent .
Pre-tax profit fell 27.3 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn , partly because of a pound(s)1.7bn impairment charge on Vodafone 's troubled Turkish business .
unused1 The interim dividend rose 3.2 per cent to 2.57p.
Vodafone is expected to say next week that its core profit margin will continue to fall in the current financial year , as the world 's largest mobile phone group by revenue fights fierce competition in its European markets .
Leading industry analysts said Vodafone was likely to indicate at its 2006-07 results presentation on Tuesday that the group 's margin would deteriorate further in the year to March 31 2008 .
Vodafone warned in May last year that its margin on organic adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation should decline by one percentage point in 2006-07 , continuing a trend that began in 2005-06 .
The deteriorating margin position highlighted at Vodafone 's half- year results in November 2005 put pressure on Arun Sarin , the group 's chief executive , although his relations with investors have since recovered .
unused1 In a research note , he estimated revenue of Pounds 31.2bn for 2006-07 , up 6.5 per cent , and ebitda of Pounds 12bn , up 1.8 per cent , delivering a margin of 38.3 per cent .
But Mr Delfas , who has a " buy " rating on Vodafone , calculated the margin would fall to 37.5 per cent in 2007-08 .
Mr Sinclair , who has a " hold " rating on Vodafone , estimated the margin would be 36.4 per cent in 2007-08 , partly because of spending on new customers .
Vodafone is seeking to expand into emerging markets , and last month bought Hutchison Essar , India 's fourth largest mobile operator .
Vodafone 's shares closed up 6.2 per cent at 115p after the world 's largest mobile phone operator confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound(s)11bn ( $16.9bn ) to pound(s)11.5bn for 2008-09 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements .
Vodafone 's revenue rose 17.1 per cent to pound(s)19.9bn in the six months to September 30 .
unused1 Adjusted operating profit rose 10.5 per cent to pound(s)5.8bn , fuelled by sterling 's weakness .
unused1 On an underlying basis , operating profit fell 1 per cent .
Pre-tax profits fell 27.3 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn , partly because of pound(s)1.7bn impairment charge on Vodafone 's troubled Turkish business .

" Vodafone earns 55 per cent of its operating profits in euros plus around 27 per cent in US dollars , " Cazenove said , reiterating its " overweight " recommendation .
" Although underlying sales trends continue to deteriorate , Next has planned for weak demand and kept its inventory tight .
unused1 Oriel Securities repeated its " buy " rating arguing that DSG 's customer support agreements and its Nordic business , Elkjop , were worth pound(s)1.3bn.
unused1 " With the stock trading below embedded value , and with Asian sales likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next five years , we retain an overweight rating , " the broker , which has a 989p target price , said .
unused1 The weak oil price and a downgrade from RBS did the damage .
unused1 Moving to a " hold " rating , RBS said the lack of commercial success at the Chim Cng well in Vietnam and a six month gap in Premier 's drilling schedule would weigh on the share price .
RBS also cut ratings on Venture Production , off 5.8 per cent to 737 1/2 p , and Salamander Energy , down 5.2 per cent at 250p .
The record payout will be boosted by the pound(s)16.6bn special dividend from Vodafone , the study points out .
unused1 Altogether , the telecoms group is handing shareholders just over pound(s)54bn - almost three-quarters of the net proceeds from the sale of its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless .
Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound(s)2.4bn dividend from US operator Verizon Wireless , in which Vodafone owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with Verizon Communications .
Vodafone 's management will use the cash to fund a pound(s)1.5bn share buy-back programme .
unused1 Cash profits attributable to Vodafone from Verizon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound(s)4.49bn - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2.2 per cent to pound(s)6.2bn.
unused1 Mobile data revenue climbed 4 per cent to pound(s)1.64bn in the second quarter and voice and messaging combined saw revenue slump 14 per cent to pound(s)6.87bn.
unused1 Broker Bernstein forecasts full-year adjusted earnings per share of 15.25p ( 14.91p in 2012 ) , rising to 15.79p in 2014 .
On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture with Verizon Communications , ruled out regular dividends .
unused1 This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $10bn dividend - its first since 2005 .
It is not a secret that Verizon stopped paying dividends in an effort to force Vodafone to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to Verizon .
But since then Verizon Wireless 's trapped cash has been put to good use repaying its debt and Vodafone and Verizon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) .
unused1 On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1.4 per cent year on year in the second quarter .
But Vodafone 's revenue growth also slowed from first-quarter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3.2 per cent decline in the UK .
unused1 Result : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009-10 .
unused1 First-half earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , at pound(s)6.6bn , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the ebitda margin slipped to 30.5 per cent , compared with 31.2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) .
Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent-owned Verizon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $8.5bn dividend to its two parents .
The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade-off for an earlier payout , and Vodafone will return pound(s)1.5bn to investors via a share buyback .
unused1 The non-European interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1.8 times ebitda .
unused1 The growth rate of Vodafone 's Indian revenue , which accounts for less than a 10th of its total sales , slowed to 13 per cent last year and was less than half that in the final quarter .
Vodafone 's full-year earnings yesterday were like that .
unused1 Underlying revenues from phone services were down more than 4 per cent year-on-year in the final three months to March , the weakest quarterly result to date .
So , with Vodafone looking to take pound(s)300m out of European operating expenses this year and seeing good growth in data usage , executives are projecting a 2013/14 operating profit of pound(s)12bn-pound(s)12.8bn.
unused1 But dividends are pledged to stay at current levels , giving a 5.5 per cent yield .
unused1 In its first-quarter results on Friday , the UK-based mobile operator confirmed the complete dichotomy it faces in its markets .
unused1 Revenues in Turkey increased 32 per cent and India were up by 17 per cent ( although intense competition there limits profitability ) .
unused1 On the flip side , the mature European business - which contributes about 70 per cent of revenues - barely grew as it nursed revenue falls of 10 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in Greece .
unused1 A pound(s)4bn share buy-back programme now under way will increase that figure to 1.8 times - which would remain about 10 per cent below the company 's target .
Verizon has long looked to its successful US Verizon Wireless business to prop up its declining fixed-line earnings .
unused1 But having spent six years trying to starve out the UK operator by freezing dividend payments , it has now given up .
Vodafone 's chief executive Vittorio Colao had much pressure on him to return cash to investors , but his decision to return pound(s)2bn of the dividend to shareholders is not a cave-in .
Vodafone acquisition of C&WW opposed by Orbis
Vodafone agreed a pound(s)1bn takeover offer for Cable& Wireless Worldwide , although it could face opposition after C&WW 's largest shareholder refused to back the deal .
Vodafone , which has been considering a bid for C&WW since February , tabled a final offer at 38p per share , valuing the group 's equity at just over pound(s)1bn .
The price offered by Vodafone is almost twice that of the C&WW share price before its expression of interest , although this had dropped about three-quarters since demerger from Cable & Wireless Communications , a UK-listed overseas telecoms business .
On Tuesday , Vodafone wrote to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the India 's markets regulator to object to plans by Essar , which holds 33 per cent of Vodafone Essar , to merge 11 per cent of its stake into India Securities ( ISL ) , a small public company .
unused1 Essar , which has an option until May to sell its 33 per cent stake in the venture to Vodafone for $5bn , or sell a smaller stake at market value , said that the UK group had no power to change its plans to merge Essar 's telecoms business with ISL .
unused1 The British group has been involved in a protracted legal battle with the Indian authorities , who are pursuing Vodafone for $2.5bn in back tax related to its 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Essar for $11bn .
unused1 In 2007-08 , the business recorded a profit margin of 33 per cent based on earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation as a percentage of sales .
unused1 But by 2009-10 that margin had slipped to 26 per cent .
Verizon 's first-quarter profit beat forecasts thanks to better than expected mobile subscriber sign-ups and a sector-leading profit margin .

Vodafone has been tidying up its portfolio of businesses in western Europe , where fierce competition and pressure from regulators for price cuts has resulted in slowing revenue growth and declining profit margins .
Vodafone raised its outlook for full-year operating profit on the back of a stronger performance than expected in most of its big markets , which outweighed a pound(s)450m charge in its embattled Greek operations .
Vodafone reported revenue of pound(s)23.5bn for the six months to September 30 , up 4.1 per cent from the same time last year , and underlying operating profit of pound(s)6bn , down 0.6 per cent .
unused1 Pre-tax profit fell 2.8 per cent to pound(s)8.01bn , partly because of higher financing costs and lower investment income after it sold minority stakes in Chinese and Japanese mobile operators .
Mr Colao highlighted how Vodafone had secured a pound(s)2.8bn dividend from Verizon Wireless , its first for seven years , on which it would pay a special dividend of 4p in February .

unused1 Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile phone company , yesterday agreed to buy a 70 per cent stake in Ghana Telecom for $900m , gaining a controlling stake in Africa 's eighth largest mobile network .

Ghana Telecom reported revenue growth of 9.3 per cent in the 12 months ended December 31 last year to $290m and earnings of $42m .
Sir John said of Verizon Wireless at the annual meeting : " The prospect for dividends is now very good , with Verizon 's management confirming a pay-out in 2012 . "
Some investors have become increasingly critical of Mr Sarin since Vodafone warned last November of slowing revenue growth and reduced profit margins .
unused1 In May it announced a record pre-tax loss for its 2006 fiscal year of Pounds 14.9bn.
But shareholders were alarmed by how Vodafone 's European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of group sales , for the first time reported falling underlying revenue in 2008-2009 .
Vodafone had been hoping for a resumption of dividends in 2009 after Verizon Wireless paid down its debt , but the timetable was pushed back to 2012 by the acquisition of Alltel , a smaller US mobile operator .
On-off talks between Verizon Communications and Vodafone about the future of Verizon Wireless may finally be entering an end game , however , because the mobile operator is expected to be debt-free by the end of next year .
unused1 Vodafone has been urging its shareholders to be patient , even though some have long been unhappy about the lack of Verizon Wireless ' dividends .
Verizon Communications paid a dividend worth $5.3bn in 2009 and Bernstein analysts said that problems at the US group 's fixed-line phone business meant that it will need to tap Verizon Wireless ' cash so as to maintain its shareholder remuneration .
Vodafone confirms talks with C&WW
Shares in Cable & Wireless Worldwide jumped almost 45 per cent after Vodafone confirmed that it was interested in bidding for the troubled telecoms group .
Vodafone 's interest surprised the market given the troubled financial position of C&W Worldwide , which had been struck by three profit warnings in 12 months after the corporate-focused business was demerged from the consumer side of the Cable & Wireless group in March 2010 .
Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile phone operator , caused jitters among investors yesterday when it lowered its guidance for margins and revenue growth for the current year amid warnings of intensifying competition .

Some of Vodafone 's main European businesses , such as those in the UK and Spain , are expected to report declining revenue , because consumers are spending less on their mobile phones during the recession .
Analysts at Bernstein say one possible piece of good news is the potential for an earlier than expected resumption of dividend payments by Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator .
Verizon Wireless stopped issuing dividends in 2005 , after Verizon Communications decided to use Verizon Wireless 's cash flow to pay down the mobile operator 's debt .
When Verizon Wireless last year agreed to buy Alltel , a smaller rival , Vodafone said it did not expect a resumption of dividend payments until 2012 .

Vodafone reveals plan for pound(s)1bn share buy-back
Vodafone has taken the unusual step of revealing a pound(s)1bn share buy-back in immediate response to the record sell-off of its stock after Tuesday 's revenue warning .
Announcing the pound(s)1bn share buy-back yesterday , the company said : " This action reflects the board 's belief that the share price significantly undervalues Vodafone . "
Graham Secker , equity strategist at Morgan Stanley , said Vodafone 's share buyback , while unusual , may be well timed .
Vodafone scaled back its revenue forecast for 2008-09 at its first-quarter trading update , partly because some people were delaying upgrades of mobile phones .
On March 31 , Vodafone had net debt of pound(s)25.2bn.
Standard & Poor 's , the ratings agency , said Vodafone 's ratings were unchanged by the buy-back , but added : " A weakening of operating performance . . . or any future revision of guidance for 2009 , could put pressure on the ratings and outlook . "

Vodafone was built into the world 's biggest mobile phone operator by revenue by a series of large deals such as the Pounds 101bn acquisition of Germany 's Mannesman in 2000 .
Vodafone had already rattled investors in November by warning that revenue growthwould be lower in 2007 than in 2006 .

unused1 Consensus first-half earnings are put at pound(s)6.8bn , a 10 per cent decline but mostly owing to foreign exchange movements .
unused1 Stripping out this , analysts expect group ebitda to be down about 2.5 per cent in the first half .
If the competition authorities approve plans for a merger between France Telecom 's Orange UK and Deutsche Telekom 's TMobile UK , the new entity would become the market leader , with O2 in second place .
Ben Wood , analyst at CCS Insight , said Vodafone would be the biggest loser from a merger between Orange UK and T-Mobile UK , which are the third and fourth-largest mobile operators respectively .
Meanwhile , analysts said O2 's chances of retaining its status as the exclusive UK network for Apple 's popular iPhone have been diminished by the merger plans involving Orange UK and T-Mobile UK .
unused1 The French and German companies are expected to argue that the pound(s)3.5bn ( $5.8bn ) of cost savings sought in the merger should enable higher investment in networks that will support web surfing and other data activities on mobile phones and laptops .

Mr Sarin sought to allay investor concern by drawing attention to Vodafone 's guidance last May that the group 's ebitda margin would fall by one percentage point in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 .
Cuts in Vodafone 's tariffs have bolstered revenue growth , partly by attracting new customers .
unused1 Service revenue growth increased 5 per cent in January and February compared with the same period last year .
unused1 " The UK margins are weaker than expected and , while revenue growth is stronger , we doubt it will be able to sustain this higher growth rate for long , " said Martin Mabbutt , analyst at Nomura , who has a " buy " rating on the stock .
unused1 Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded their recommendation on Vodafone 's shares from " buy " to " sell " after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at Vodafone 's European mobile businesses by Pounds 900m ( Dollars 1.78bn ) between 2009 and 2012 .
Meanwhile , Vodafone also had a further setback in its efforts to secure control of Vodacom , South Africa 's leading mobile operator .
unused1 He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would reduce Vodafone 's European earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation by 11 per cent , or Pounds 900m .
unused1 That would equate to a 8 per cent cut in the group 's ebitda .
US telecoms group Verizon denied it was considering a bid for Vodafone , halting a rally across Europe 's telecom sector .

unused1 Vodafone 's EUR8bn ( $11.4bn ) sale to Vivendi of a 44 per cent stake in the French mobile phone business SFR , announced on Monday , is the biggest in a series of disposals of minority holdings .
Analysts broadly agreed that Vodafone secured a good price for its stake in SFR , given that Vivendi - which owned the remaining shares in the group - had been reported to be unwilling to pay more than pound(s)6bn ( $9.7bn ) .

unused1 Vodafone said that the pound(s)2.1bn Verizon dividend was " to be retained in the business for general business purposes , including spectrum costs " - a move that quashes speculation of a new share buyback scheme after the current programme expires in July .
